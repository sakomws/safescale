# Shared Responsibility Environment:

Moving the customer’s IT infrastructure to AWS builds a shared responsibility model between customers and AWS. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. In turn, customers assume responsibility and management of the design, implementation and operation of their AWS environment, which may include guest operating systems (including updates and security patches), other associated application software, as well as the configuration of the AWS-provided security group firewall. Customers should carefully consider the services they choose as customer responsibilities vary depending on the services they use, the integration of those services into their IT environments, and applicable laws and regulations. It is possible to enhance security and/or meet more stringent compliance requirements by leveraging technology such as host-based firewalls, host-based intrusion detection/prevention, and encryption. AWS provides tools and information to assist customers in their efforts to account for and to validate that controls are operating effectively in their extended IT environment. More information can be found on the AWS Compliance center at https://aws.amazon.com/compliance.

AWS offers a variety of different infrastructure and platform services. More information can be found on the AWS Shared Responsibility Model at https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/. For the purpose of understanding security and shared responsibility for AWS’ services, AWS has categorized them into three main categories: infrastructure, container, and abstracted. Each category comes with a slightly different security ownership model based on how customers interact and access the functionality. Customer responsibility is determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities.

# Infrastructure Services:

Services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) are categorized as Infrastructure Services and, as such, require the customer to perform the necessary security configuration and management tasks. If a customer deploys an Amazon EC2 instance, they are responsible for management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches).

#

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Security patches), any application software or utilities installed by the customer on the instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a security group) on each instance.

Container Services: Services in this category typically run separately on Amazon EC2 or other infrastructure instances, but sometimes customers are not required to manage the operating system or the platform layer. AWS provides a managed service for these application “containers”. Customers are responsible for setting up and managing network controls, such as firewall rules, and for managing platform-level identity and access management separately from IAM. Examples of container services include Amazon Relational Database Services (Amazon RDS), Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (Amazon EMR) and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Abstracted Services: This category includes high-level storage, database, and messaging services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Glacier, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Queuing Service (Amazon SQS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES). These services abstract the platform or management layer on which the customers can build and operate cloud applications. The customers access the endpoints of these abstracted services using AWS APIs, and AWS manages the underlying service components or the operating system on which they reside.

As every customer deploys their environment differently in AWS, customers can take advantage of shifting the management of certain IT controls to AWS, which results in a (new) distributed control environment. Customers can then use the AWS control and compliance documentation available to them to perform their control evaluation and verification procedures as required. Certain functions of services have been identified as controls in the system description and are denoted as “service-specific” as they are unique to the respective service.

More information and examples on the AWS Security Best Practices can be found at AWS Security Best Practices.

Furthermore, AWS publishes security blogs related to best practices that cover best practices around using AWS services at AWS Security Blogs.

# Relevant Aspects of Internal Controls

As defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), internal control is a process affected by an entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel and consists of five interrelated components:

- Control Environment – Sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the foundation for all other components of internal control, providing discipline and structure.
- Risk Assessment – The entity’s identification and analysis of relevant risks to the achievement of its objectives, forming a basis for determining how the risks should be managed.
- Information and Communication – Surrounding these activities are information and communication systems. These enable the entity’s people to capture and exchange information needed to conduct and control its operations.

#

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Monitoring – The entire process must be monitored, and modifications made as necessary. In this way, the system can react dynamically, changing as conditions warrant.

Control Activities – Control policies and procedures must be established and executed to help ensure that the actions identified by management as necessary to address risks to the achievement of the entity’s objectives are effectively carried out.

This section briefly describes the essential characteristics and other interrelated components of internal controls in achieving the service commitments and system requirements for the applicable trust services criteria of security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy as they pertain to AWS that may be relevant to customers in five broad areas:

- Policies (Control Environment and Risk Management) – The entity has defined and documented its policies relevant to the applicable trust services criteria.
- Communications (Information and Communication) – The entity has communicated its defined policies to responsible parties and authorized users of the system.
- Service Commitments and System Requirements (Control Activities) – The entity has communicated its service commitments and system requirements to customers in accordance with customer agreements.
- Procedures (Control Activities) – The entity has placed in operation procedures to achieve service commitments and systems requirements in accordance with its defined policies.
- Monitoring – The entity monitors the system and takes action to maintain compliance with its defined policies.

# A. Policies

# A.1 Control Environment

AWS is a unit within Amazon.com (“Amazon” or “the Company”) that is aligned organizationally around each of the web services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon VPC, Amazon EBS and Amazon RDS. AWS leverages some aspects of Amazon’s overall control environment in the delivery of these web services. The collective control environment encompasses management and employee efforts to establish and maintain an environment that supports the effectiveness of specific controls. AWS maintains internal informational websites describing the AWS environment, its boundaries, user responsibilities and services (Control AWSCA-9.1).

The control environment at Amazon begins at the highest level of the Company. Executive and senior leadership play important roles in establishing the Company’s core values and tone at the top. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets guiding principles, is made available to every employee.

Amazon is committed to having the highest qualified members as a part of its Board of Directors (Control AWSCA-1.7). Annually, the Amazon Corporate Governance Committee provides each Board member a questionnaire that establishes whether they are independent and qualified to serve on each Board or Committee under the applicable rules. The Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews and assesses the composition of the Board and evaluates the overall Board performance during the annual

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS is committed to protecting its customers’ data and maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. This is demonstrated by the consolidated annual operational plan that includes regulatory and compliance requirements and objectives to enable the identification and assessment of risks relating to those objectives (Control AWSCA-1.9). AWS’ policies and procedures outline the required guidance for operation and information security that supports AWS environments, acceptable use of mobile devices, and access to data content and network devices (Control AWSCA-3.16). All AWS employees are required to review all applicable policies and procedures, as updated from time to time. Evidence of compliance with the training on AWS policies is executed and retained by the employee resource team.

Amazon has setup an ethics hotline for the employees or third-party contractors to report any misconduct or violation of AWS policies, practices, rules, requirements or procedures (Control AWSCA-9.6). Any material violation of the Company Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or any other similar policies are appropriately handled accordingly which may include disciplinary action or termination of employment. Violations by vendors or third-party contractors are reported to their employers for disciplinary action, removal of assignment with Amazon, or termination (Control AWSCA-9.7).

AWS Management has implemented a formal audit program that monitors and audits controls that are designed to protect against organizational risks and customer content. This includes external independent assessments against regulatory, internal and external control frameworks. The internal and external audits are planned, performed and reported to the Audit Committee. The AWS compliance team performs and reviews the audit plan according to the documented audit schedule and communicates the audit requirements based on standard criteria that verifies compliance with the regulatory requirements and reported risk to the Audit Committee.

AWS Artifact is the primary resource for customers to obtain compliance-related information from AWS. It provides access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements. Reports available in AWS Artifact include: AWS Service System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) Attestation of Compliance, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and industry verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls. Amongst other things, compliance reports are made available to customers to enable them to evaluate AWS’ conformance with security controls and associated compliance obligations (Control AWSCA-9.8).

The AWS organizational structure provides a framework for planning, executing and controlling business operations (Control AWSCA-1.1). The organizational structure assigns roles and responsibilities to provide for adequate staffing, efficiency of operations and the segregation of duties. Management has also established authority and appropriate lines of reporting for key personnel. The Company follows a structured on-boarding process to assist new employees as they become familiar with Amazon tools, processes, systems, policies and procedures.

# AWS SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS performs a formal evaluation of the appropriate resourcing and staffing to align employee qualifications with the entity’s business objectives to support the achievement of the entity’s business objectives. Appropriate feedback is given to the employee on strengths and growth areas during the annual performance review process. Employee strength and growth evaluations are shared by the employee’s manager with the employee (Control AWSCA-9.3).

The GovCloud (US East) and GovCloud (US West) environments are AWS regions located in the United States (US) that are designed to maintain physical and logical access controls that limit access by AWS personnel to the AWS Network for the GovCloud (US) regions to US citizens. The AWS control environment described in this document is also applicable to the GovCloud (US) regions. The AWS control environment is subject to various internal and external risk assessments.

AWS has established an information security framework and regularly reviews and updates the security policies, provides security training, which includes data classification, to employees, and performs application security reviews. These reviews assess the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of data, as well as conformance to the security policies. Where necessary, AWS Security leverages the security framework and security policies established and maintained by Amazon Corporate Information Security.

AWS has a process in place to review environmental and geo-political risks before launching a new region (Control AWSCA-1.10). Risk assessments encompass reviews of natural catastrophe (e.g., extreme weather events), technological (e.g., fire, nuclear radiation, industrial pollution) and man-made (e.g., vehicle impact, intentional acts, geo-political) hazards, including exposures presented by nearby entities; as applicable. In addition to site-specific considerations, AWS evaluates scenarios potentially affecting separate AZs within a region.

# Risk Management

AWS maintains a formal risk management program to identify, analyze, treat, and continuously monitor and report risks that affect AWS’ business objectives, regulatory requirements, and customers. The AWS Risk Management (ARM) program identifies risks, documents them in a risk register, and reports results to leadership at least semi-annually. The risk management program consists of the following phases:

1. # Identifying Risks

ARM has developed a tailored approach to identifying risks across the business. The approach is:

- Bottom-up to identify existing risk management activities
- Top down to gather information from key leaders
- Cross-functional Kaizen sessions intended to deep dive in areas of need

Where appropriate, ARM conducts ad-hoc engagements with the business prompted by inbound requests or proactive outreach by the team on specific questions.
2. # Analyzing Risks

ARM reviews the identified risks with senior leaders to calibrate, assess, and prioritize. This is accomplished by evaluating:

- Probability (likelihood of occurrence in a defined time period)

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

3) Treating Risks

ARM adopts risk treatment (versus risk mitigation) as a strategy, collaborating with business SMEs to develop response plans based on the appropriate treatment option. These might include:

- Eliminating or avoiding the risk (e.g., stopping the activity)
- Reducing the risk (e.g., implementing controls)
- Transferring the risk (e.g., to a third party)
- Accepting the risk (when capacity and appetite exist)

4) Monitoring and Reporting Risks

ARM actively monitors material risks and their treatment plans. Reports are provided to senior leadership at least semi-annually. Reports may include important information about key risks and treatments, as well as emerging trends and general program updates (Control AWSCA-1.5).

In addition to the ARM Risk Assessment, Internal Audit performs a separate Risk Assessment to identify and prioritize significant AWS risks and uses this information to define the audit plan. The Risk Assessment incorporates input from multiple sources such as changes to the business, internal audits, operational events, and emerging risks. The audit plan and any changes to the plan during the year are presented to the Audit Committee. Internal Audit also communicates significant audit findings and associated action plans to the Audit Committee.

Additionally, at least on a monthly basis, AWS management reviews the AWS operational metrics and Correction of Errors (COEs) to improve the overall availability of AWS services and to identify areas of improvements while mitigating risks to our environments. The “COE” documents are used to perform deep root cause analysis of certain incidents across AWS, document actions taken, and assign follow-up action items and owners to track to resolution.

# B. Communications

AWS has implemented various methods of internal communication at a global level to help employees understand their individual roles and responsibilities and to communicate significant events in a timely manner. These methods include orientation and training programs for newly hired employees; annual training programs are tailored based on employee roles and responsibilities that may include Amazon Security Awareness (ASA) (Control AWSCA-1.4), Software Developer Engineer (SDE) Bootcamp, ITAR Secure Coding Training, Threat Modeling the Right Way for Amazon Builders Fraud/Bribery/Foreign corrupt practices training, and Privacy Engineering Foundations for AWS Service Teams confidentiality training, Managing Third Parties Using the Third-Party Risk Management Lifecycle, Export Compliance trainings; regular management meetings for updates on business performance and other matters; and electronic means such as video conferencing, electronic mail messages, and the posting of information via the Amazon intranet on topics such as reporting of information security incidents and guidelines.

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Describing change management, the AWS Internal Privacy Policy informs AWS employees and applicable vendors/contractors about AWS’ requirements regarding the privacy of customer’s personal information in accordance with applicable legislation and other AWS obligations.

# Service Commitments and System Requirements

# Service Commitments

AWS communicates service commitments to user entities (AWS customers) in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), customer agreements, contracts, or through the description of the service offerings provided online through the AWS website. More information regarding Service Level Agreements can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/legal/service-level-agreements/.

AWS uses various methods of external communication to support its customer base and the community. Mechanisms are in place to allow the AWS Support Escalation and Event Management (E2M) team to be notified and to notify customers of potential operational issues that could impact the customer experience. AWS Health Dashboard is available to alert customers of “General Service Events” which show the health of all AWS services and “Your Account Events” shows events specific to the account. Current status information can be checked by the customer on this site, or by leveraging Amazon EventBridge Integrations or RSS feeds which allow customers to be notified of interruptions to each individual service. Details related to security and compliance with AWS can also be obtained on the AWS Security Center and AWS Compliance websites.

Customers have the ability to contact AWS through the ‘Contact us’ page for any issues related to the AWS services. AWS provides publicly available mechanisms for external parties to contact AWS to report security events and publishes information including a system description and security and compliance information addressing AWS commitments and responsibilities (Control AWSCA-9.5). Customers can also subscribe to Premium Support offerings that include direct communication with the customer support team and proactive alerts for any customer impacting issues. AWS also deploys monitoring and alarming mechanisms which are configured by AWS Service Owners to identify and notify operational and management personnel of incidents when early warning thresholds are crossed on key operational metrics (Control AWSCA-8.1). Additionally, incidents are logged within a ticketing system, assigned a severity rating and tracked to resolution (Control AWSCA-8.2).

# System Requirements

The selection and use of services by AWS’ customers must be set up and operated under a shared responsibility model so that the functionality of the services and the associated security is appropriately managed. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs the service(s) offered in the AWS Cloud. The customer’s responsibility is determined by the AWS Cloud service(s) that a customer selects and the interdependencies of those services within the AWS Cloud and their own networked environment. Customers should assess the objectives for their network when designing IT components by identifying the risk and corresponding controls to be implemented to address those risks. Customers should carefully consider the services they choose as their responsibilities vary depending on the.

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

When designing and developing its services, AWS management has created internal policies that are relevant to the services and systems available to customers. The development of these policies and procedures supports management with decision making and the operational teams with business requirements and management of each service and system. As each AWS service is unique, the system requirements to use different services vary depending on the service and each customer’s environment.

As explained in the Availability section of the report, AWS has processes and infrastructure in place to make the services available to customers to meet their needs. AWS communicates its system requirements to customers and how to get started with using the AWS services in the form of user guides, developer guides, API references, service specific tutorials, or SDK toolkits. More information regarding the AWS Documentation can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/. These resources help the customers with architecting the AWS services to satisfy their business needs.

AWS has identified the following objectives to support the security, change, and operational processes underlying their service commitments and business requirements. The objectives ensure the system operates and mitigates the risks that threaten the achievement of the service commitments and system requirements. The objectives below provide reasonable assurance that:

- Data integrity is maintained through all phases, including transmission, storage and processing.
- Procedures have been established so that Amazon employee user accounts are added, modified and deleted in a timely manner and reviewed on a periodic basis.
- Policies and mechanisms are in place to appropriately restrict unauthorized internal and external access to data and customer content is appropriately segregated from other customers.
- System incidents are recorded, analyzed and resolved.
- Changes (including emergency/non-routine and configuration) to existing IT resources are logged, authorized, tested, approved and documented.
- Critical system components are replicated across multiple Availability Zones and authoritative backups are maintained and monitored to ensure successful replication to meet the service commitments.
- Controls are implemented to safeguard data from within and outside of the boundaries of environments which store a customer’s content to meet the service commitments.
- Procedures have been established so that the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of customer content within AWS services is in accordance with the service commitments.

It includes privacy, data protection, and data handling leading practices. AWS follows the three lines of defense model by the Institute of Internal Auditors, where operational management is the first line of defense, risk control and compliance functions are the second line, and independent assurance is the third.

Note: This information is proprietary and confidential to Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.
---
#

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

As its third line of defense, Amazon has an Internal Audit function to periodically evaluate risks and assess conformance to AWS security processes with due professional care (Control AWSCA-9.8). Further, AWS Security Assurance works with third-party assessors to obtain an independent assessment of risk management content/processes by performing periodic security assessments and compliance audits or examinations (e.g., SOC, FedRAMP, ISO, PCI) to evaluate the security, integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information and resources. AWS management also collaborates with Internal Audit to determine the health of the AWS control environment and leverages this information to fairly present the assertions made within the reports.

# D.2 Employee User Access

Procedures exist so that Amazon employee and contractor user accounts are added, modified, or disabled in a timely manner and are reviewed on a periodic basis. In addition, password configuration settings for user authentication to AWS systems are managed in compliance with Amazon’s Password Policy.

AWS has established policies and procedures to delineate standards for logical access to AWS systems and infrastructure hosts. Where permitted by law, AWS requires that employees undergo a background screening, at the time of hiring, commensurate with their position and level of access, in accordance with the AWS Personnel Security Policy (Control AWSCA-9.2). The policies also identify functional responsibilities for the administration of logical access and security.

Additionally, AWS employees who have access to systems that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability, or privacy of customer content are required to complete a post-hire background screening within a year from their last background check. Post-hire screening includes criminal screening requirements consistent with the pre-hire background screening. Access to the systems that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability, or privacy of customer content is managed by membership in permission groups. Employees who support internal services or have access to network resources are not required to complete the post-hire background screening. Post-hire background screening is conducted where it is legally permissible by local law, in accordance with the AWS Personnel Security Policy (Control AWSCA-9.9).

# Account Provisioning

The responsibility for provisioning user access, which includes employee and contractor access is shared across Human Resources (HR), Corporate Operations, and Service Owners.

A standard employee or contractor account with minimum privileges is provisioned in a disabled state when a hiring manager submits his or her new employee or contractor onboarding request in Amazon’s HR system. The account is automatically enabled after the employee’s record is activated in Amazon’s HR system. First time passwords are set to a unique value and are required to be changed on first use (Control AWSCA-2.1).

# Access Management

AWS employs the concept of least privilege, allowing only the necessary access for users to accomplish their job function. User accounts are created to have minimal access. Access above these least privileges requires appropriate and separate authorization.
---
#

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

# Access Control and Permissions

Access to resources including Services, Hosts, Network devices, and Windows and UNIX groups is approved in Amazon’s proprietary permission management system by the appropriate owner or manager. Requests for changes in access are captured in the Amazon permissions management tool audit log. Continued access must be approved when changes in an employee’s job function occur, or it will be automatically revoked (Control AWSCA-2.2).

# Periodic Access Review

Access control lists or permission groups granting access to critical infrastructure are reviewed periodically. AWS conducts quarterly reviews of access to systems supporting the infrastructure and network, requiring explicit re-approval or access revocation. Semi-annual reviews are conducted for access to AWS accounts. Access to operational systems is revoked when a user no longer has a required business need (Control AWSCA-2.3).

# Access Removal

Access is revoked when an employee’s record is terminated in Amazon’s HR system. Windows and UNIX accounts are disabled, and the user is removed from all systems in Amazon’s permission management system (Control AWSCA-2.4).

# Password Policy

Logical security for Amazon relies on user IDs, passwords, and Kerberos for authentication and authorization. AWS Security has established a password policy with required configurations and expiration intervals. A credential monitoring and response process is in place to monitor compromised credentials and rotate impacted user credentials promptly (Control AWSCA-2.5).

# Remote Access

AWS requires two-factor authentication over an approved cryptographic channel for remote access to the internal AWS network (Control AWSCA-2.6).

# Logical Security

Procedures and mechanisms are in place to restrict unauthorized internal and external access to data. Customer content is segregated from other customers, and APIs enable customers to manage access to AWS services and resources they own. AWS prevents unauthorized access to resources and ensures content is only returned to authorized individuals (Control AWSCA-3.5).

# AWS Application Security (AppSec) Reviews

AWS performs Application Security (AppSec) reviews for externally launched products, services, and significant feature additions. The Application Security team collects detailed information for the review, tracks reviews against an inventory, reviews IAM policies, and collaborates with service teams to remediate security findings. Final approval for launch is granted only after completion of the review.

# AWS Network Security

The AWS Network includes internal data center facilities, servers, networking equipment, and host software systems. It provides protection against DDoS attacks, MITM attacks, IP spoofing, and port scanning through various controls and measures.

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: AWS API endpoints use proprietary DDoS mitigation techniques and are multi-homed for Internet access diversity.
- Man in the Middle (MITM) Attacks: AWS APIs are available via TLS/SSL-protected endpoints, and EC2 instances generate new SSH host certificates for secure access.
- IP Spoofing: AWS-controlled firewall infrastructure prevents instances from sending traffic with unauthorized IP or MAC addresses.
- Port Scanning: Unauthorized port scans are a violation of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy. Customers can report abuse, and strict security group management helps mitigate port scan threats.

Customers can request permission for vulnerability scans to meet compliance requirements, subject to AWS policies and approval processes.

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Packet sniffing by other tenants: Virtual instances are designed to prevent other instances running in promiscuous mode to receive or “sniff” traffic that is intended for a different virtual instance. Customers can encrypt sensitive traffic as standard practice (Control AWSCA-3.10).

Anti-virus software installed on workstations: Anti-virus software is deployed and running on Amazon corporate workstations. Checks are in place to ensure compliance and provide quarantining tooling for non-compliant workstations (Control AWSCA-3.18).

Firewall devices: Configured to restrict access to production networks (Control AWSCA-3.1). Firewall policies are maintained via automatic push from a parent server, with all changes reviewed and approved (Controls AWSCA-3.2, AWSCA-3.3).

Vulnerability scans: Regular scans are performed on host operating systems, web applications, and databases in the AWS environment. AWS Security teams monitor vendor flaws and patches, with customers able to report issues via the AWS Vulnerability Reporting website (Control AWSCA-3.4).

Virtualization techniques: AWS employs virtual networking devices, host-based firewalls, and Access Control Lists (ACLs) in EC2 and VPC to control traffic flow restrictions. Customers are responsible for configuring server resources within the customer VPC.

External Access Control: Customers configure external access to services via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), enabling secure control over access to AWS services and resources. Security Groups act as firewalls and control access to in-scope applications (Control AWSCA-3.5).

Interacting with the Service: AWS provides various methods of interacting with services, including APIs, SDKs, the AWS Management Console, and the AWS command line interface, all following standard AWS authentication and authorization practices.

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Authenticated calls to AWS services are signed by either an X.509 certificate and/or the customer's AWS
Secret Access Key. When using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to
make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests with the access key specified by the
customer when the tools were configured. Manually created requests must be signed using Signature
Version 4 or Signature Version 2. All AWS services support Signature Version 4, except Amazon SimpleDB,
which requires Signature Version 2. For AWS services that support both versions, it is recommended to
use Signature Version 4.

Internal Logging

AWS maintains centralized repositories that provide core log archival functionality available for internal
use by AWS service teams. Leveraging S3 for high scalability, durability, and availability allows service
teams to collect, archive, and view service logs in a central log service.

Production hosts at AWS are deployed using master baseline images (Control AWSCA-9.4). The baseline
images are equipped with a standard set of configurations and functions including logging and monitoring
for security purposes.

These logs are stored and accessible by AWS security teams for root cause analysis in the event of a
suspected security incident. Logs for a given host are also available to the team that owns that host in
case the team needs to search their logs for operational and security analysis.

Encryption

Amazon cryptographic policy defines the appropriate cryptography implementation through the Amazon
cryptographic standard. The cryptography standard is based on FIPS standards, NIST standards, and/or
the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (Suite B). Implementation guidance including
appropriate key length and algorithm specific parameters are provided to service teams through
application security reviews. Additionally, AWS Security Engineers within the cryptography review
program review the appropriate use of cryptography within AWS. In addition, API calls can be encrypted
with TLS/SSL to maintain confidentiality. It is the customer’s responsibility to appropriately configure and
manage usage and implementation of available encryption options to meet compliance requirements.

The production firmware version of the AWS Key Management Service HSM (Hardware Security Module)
has been validated with NIST under the latest FIPS 140-2 standard or is in the process of being validated
(Control AWSCA-4.14). The AWS KMS team works with a vendor (Example: Acumen) who in turn works
with NIST to get new HSM firmware versions validated. Every new firmware version that gets deployed
into production goes through the NIST validation process and is submitted to NIST’s Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP) in order to obtain FIPS 140-2 validation. As the HSM validation process takes
4-6 months to complete, the AWS KMS team initiates the revalidation process with the vendor and may
start deployment while the firmware validation is in process.

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

CloudFront delivers customers' content through a worldwide network of Edge locations. When an end user requests content that customers serve with CloudFront, the user is routed to the Edge location that provides the lowest latency, so content is delivered with the best possible performance. If the content is already in that Edge location, CloudFront delivers it immediately.

In addition to Edge locations, CloudFront also uses Amazon Cloud Extension (ACE). ACE is a CloudFront infrastructure (single-rack version) deployed to a non-Amazon controlled facility, namely an internet service provider (ISP) or partner network. Qualifying Network Operators can deliver CloudFront content efficiently and cost effectively from within their network by deploying ACE in their data centers.

AWS CloudHSM is a service that allows customers to use dedicated hardware security module (HSM) appliances within the AWS cloud. AWS CloudHSM is designed for applications where the use of HSM appliances for encryption and key storage is mandatory.

AWS acquires these production HSM devices securely using the tamper evident authenticable bags from the vendors. These tamper evident authenticable bag serial numbers and production HSM serial numbers are verified against data provided out-of-band by the manufacturer and logged by approved individuals in tracking systems (Control AWSCA-4.15).

AWS CloudHSM allows customers to store and use encryption keys within HSM appliances in AWS data centers. With AWS CloudHSM, customers maintain full ownership, control, and access to keys and sensitive data while Amazon manages the HSM appliances in close proximity to customer applications and data. All HSM media is securely decommissioned and physically destroyed, verified by two personnel, prior to leaving AWS Secure Zones (Control AWSCA-5.13).

# Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is Amazon’s Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) offering, which provides scalable computing capacity using server instances in AWS’ data centers. Amazon EC2 is designed to make web-scale computing easier by enabling customers to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. Customers create and launch instances, which are virtual machines that are available in a wide variety of hardware and software configurations.

Security within Amazon EC2 is provided on multiple levels: the operating system (OS) of the host layer, the virtual instance OS or guest OS, a firewall, and signed API calls. Each of these items builds on the capabilities of the others. This helps prevent data contained within Amazon EC2 from being intercepted by unauthorized systems or users and to provide Amazon EC2 instances themselves security without sacrificing flexibility of configuration. The Amazon EC2 service utilizes a hypervisor to provide memory and CPU isolation between virtual machines and controls access to network, storage, and other devices, and maintains strong isolation between guest virtual machines. Independent auditors regularly assess the security of Amazon EC2 and penetration teams regularly search for new and existing vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

AWS prevents customers from accessing physical hosts or instances not assigned to them by filtering through the virtualization software (Control AWSCA-3.12).

Amazon EC2 provides a complete firewall solution, referred to as a Security Group; this mandatory inbound firewall is configured in a default deny-all mode and Amazon EC2 customers must explicitly open the ports needed to allow inbound traffic (Control AWSCA-3.9).

# AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows users to create and manage cryptographic keys. One class of keys, KMS keys, are designed to never be exposed in plaintext outside the service. KMS keys can be used to encrypt data directly submitted to the service. KMS keys can also be used to protect other types of keys, Data Encryption Keys (DEKs), which are created by the service and returned to the user’s application for local use. AWS KMS only creates and returns DEKs to users; the service does not store or manage DEKs.

AWS KMS is integrated with several AWS services so that users can request that resources in those services are encrypted with unique DEKs provisioned by KMS that are protected by a KMS key the user chooses at the time the resource is created (Control AWSCA-4.6). Integrated services use the plaintext DEK from AWS KMS in volatile memory of service-controlled endpoints; they do not store the plaintext DEK to persistent disk. An encrypted copy of the DEK is stored to persistent disk by the service and passed back to AWS KMS for decryption each time the DEK is needed to decrypt content the customer requests. DEKs provisioned by AWS KMS are encrypted with a 256-bit key unique to the customer’s account under a defined mode of AES – Advanced Encryption Standard (Control AWSCA-4.7).

When a customer requests AWS KMS to create a KMS key, the service creates a key ID for the KMS key and (optionally) key material, referred to as a backing key, which is tied to the key ID of the KMS key. The 256-bit backing key can only be used for encrypt or decrypt operations by the service (Control AWSCA-4.10). Customers can choose to have a KMS key ID created and then securely import their own key material to associate with the key ID. If the customer chooses to enable key rotation for a KMS key with a backing key that the service generated, AWS KMS will create a new version of the backing key for each rotation event, but the key ID remains the same (Control AWSCA-4.11). All future encrypt operations under the key ID will use the newest backing key, while all previous versions of backing keys are retained to decrypt ciphertexts created under the previous version of the key. Backing keys and customer-imported keys are encrypted under AWS-controlled keys when created/imported and they are only ever stored on disk in encrypted form.

All requests to AWS KMS APIs are logged and available in the AWS CloudTrail of the requester and the owner of the key. The logged requests provide information about who made the request, under which KMS key, and describes information about the AWS resource that was protected through the use of the

AWS KMS creates and manages multiple distributed replicas of KMS keys and key metadata automatically to enable high availability and data durability. KMS keys themselves are regional objects; plaintext versions of the KMS keys can only be used in the AWS region in which they were created. KMS keys are only stored on persistent disk in encrypted form and in two separate storage systems to ensure durability. When a plaintext KMS key is needed to fulfill an authorized customer request, it is retrieved from storage, decrypted on one of many AWS KMS hardened security appliances in the region, then used only in memory to execute the cryptographic operation (e.g., encrypt or decrypt). The plaintext key is then marked for deletion so that it cannot be re-used. Future requests to use the KMS key each require the decryption of the KMS key in memory for another one-time use.

AWS KMS endpoints are only accessible via TLS using specific cipher suites that support forward secrecy:

- ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
- ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
- ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384
- ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
- ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256
- ECDHE-RSA-3DES-CBC3-SHA
- DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256 (ParamSize: 2048)
- DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 (ParamSize: 2048)
- DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA (ParamSize: 2048)
- DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA (ParamSize: 2048)

By design, no one can gain access to the plaintext KMS key material. Plaintext KMS keys are only ever present on hardened security appliances for the amount of time needed to perform cryptographic operations under them. AWS employees have no tools to retrieve plaintext keys from these hardened security appliances. In addition, multi-party access controls are enforced for operations on these hardened security appliances to minimize unauthorized access or changes to the system.

Key material used for disaster recovery processes by KMS are physically secured to prevent unauthorized access. Access attempts to recovery key materials are reviewed periodically by authorized operators. Roles and responsibilities for cryptographic custodians with access to key material are formally documented and acknowledged.

Notifications provide URLs to direct users to resources on the Management Console, to enable further action and remediation.

# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables customers to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where AWS resources can be launched in a virtual network defined by the customer. Customers can connect their existing infrastructure to the network isolated Amazon EC2 instances within their Amazon VPC, including extending their existing management capabilities, such as security services, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to include their instances via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. The VPN service provides end-to-end network isolation by using an IP address range of a customer’s choice, and routing all of their network traffic between their Amazon VPC and another network designated by the customer via an encrypted Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN.

Customers can optionally connect their VPC to the Internet by adding an Internet Gateway (IGW) or a NAT Gateway. An IGW allows bi-directional access to and from the internet for some instances in the VPC based on the routes a customer defines, which specify which IP address traffic should be routable from the internet, Security Groups, and Network ACLs (NACLS) which limit which instances can accept or send this traffic. Customers can also optionally configure a NAT Gateway which allows egress-only traffic initiated from a VPC instance to reach the internet, but not allow traffic initiated from the internet to reach VPC instances. This is accomplished by mapping the private IP addresses to a public address on the way out, and then map the public IP address to the private address on the return trip.

The objective of this architecture is to isolate AWS resources and data in one Amazon VPC from another Amazon VPC, and to help prevent data transferred from outside the Amazon network except where the

The Amazon Web Services system allows customers to configure internet connectivity options or establish an IPsec VPN connection to their off-cloud network.

# Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

An Amazon VPC is an isolated portion of the AWS cloud where customers can deploy Amazon EC2 instances into subnets, segmenting the VPC's IP address range as designated by the customer. Amazon EC2 instances within a VPC can be accessed via Internal Gateway (IGW), Virtual Gateway (VGW), or VPC Peerings.

# IPsec VPN

An IPsec VPN connection connects a customer's Amazon VPC to another network, securing IP communications by authenticating and encrypting each IP packet. Customers can establish an IPsec VPN connection by creating an IKE security association between gateways and forming an IPsec security association for encrypted traffic.

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

# D.5 Secure Data Handling

AWS provides many methods for customers to securely handle their data. There are additional methods detailed in the Complementary User Entity Controls at the end of this section. AWS enables customers to open a secure, encrypted channel to AWS servers using HTTPS (TLS/SSL).

Amazon S3 provides a mechanism that enables users to utilize MD5 checksums to validate that data sent to AWS is bitwise identical to what is received, and that data sent by Amazon S3 is identical to what is received by the user. When customers choose to provide their own keys for encryption and decryption of Amazon S3 objects (S3 SSE-C), Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key provided by the customer. Amazon S3 generates and stores a one-way salted HMAC of the customer encryption key and that salted HMAC value is not logged (Control AWSCA-4.4).

Upon initial communication with an AWS-provided Windows AMI, AWS enables secure communication by configuring Terminal Services on the instance and generating a unique self-signed X.509 server certificate and delivering the certificate’s thumbprint to the user over a trusted channel (Control AWSCA-4.2).

AWS further enables secure communication with Linux AMIs, by configuring SSH on the instance, generating a unique host-key and delivering the key’s fingerprint to the user over a trusted channel (Control AWSCA-4.1).

Connections between customer applications and Amazon RDS MySQL instances can be encrypted using TLS/SSL. Amazon RDS generates a TLS/SSL certificate for each database instance, which can be used to establish an encrypted connection using the default MySQL client. Once an encrypted connection is established, data transferred between the database instance and a customer’s application will be encrypted during transfer. If customers require data to be encrypted while “at rest” in the database, the customer application must manage the encryption and decryption of data. Additionally, customers can set up controls to have their database instances only accept encrypted connections for specific user accounts.

# D.6 Physical Security and Environmental Protection

Amazon has significant experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied to the AWS system and infrastructure. Refer to the “Amazon Web Services System Overview” section above for list of in-scope data centers.

# Physical Security

AWS provides physical access to its data centers for approved employees and contractors who have a legitimate business need for such privileges. Access to data centers must be approved by an authorized individual (Control AWSCA-5.1). All visitors are required to present identification and are signed in and escorted by authorized staff.

When an employee or contractor no longer requires these privileges, his or her access is promptly revoked, even if he or she continues to be an employee of Amazon or AWS. In addition, access is automatically revoked when an employee’s record is terminated in Amazon’s HR system (Control AWSCA-5.2).

5.2). Cardholder access to data centers is reviewed quarterly. Cardholders marked for removal have their
access automatically revoked as part of the review (Control AWSCA-5.3).

Physical access is controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security
staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff
utilize multi-factor authentication mechanisms to access data center floors (Control AWSCA-5.4, AWSCA-
5.5, and AWSCA-5.6).

In addition to the physical security controls, physical access to data centers in the GovCloud (US) region is
restricted to employees or contractors who have been validated as a U.S. person (green card holder or
citizen as defined by the U.S. Department of State).

Amazon owns and operates many of its data centers, while others are housed in colocation spaces that
are offered by various reputable companies under contract with Amazon. The physical access and security
controls described above are also deployed by AWS at colocation spaces. In addition, AWS also has single
racks deployed in non-Amazon controlled facilities, Amazon CloudFront Extension (ACE). In these facilities,
the third-party vendor provides the first line of physical security that meets AWS’ established
requirements.

AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment managed and supported by AWS that
places AWS compute, storage, database and other select services closer to large population, industry, IT
centers or customers where no AWS Region currently exists today. With AWS Local Zones, customers can
easily run latency-sensitive portions of applications local to end-users and resources in a specific
geography, delivering single-digit millisecond latency for specific use cases. Dedicated Local Zones are
deployed on-premises, delivered in accordance with a customer specific contract, and dedicated to that
customer, that meets AWS established physical security requirements.

AWS offers Wavelength infrastructure in partnership with Telco providers, which is optimized for mobile
edge computing applications. Wavelength Zones are AWS infrastructure deployments that embed AWS
compute and storage services within communications service providers’ (CSP or telecom providers) data
centers at the edge of the 5G network, so application traffic from 5G devices can reach application servers
running in Wavelength Zones without leaving the telecommunications network. This avoids the latency
that would result from application traffic having to traverse multiple hops across the Internet to reach
their destination, enabling customers to take full advantage of the latency and bandwidth benefits offered
by modern 5G networks.

Contracts with third-party colocation providers include provisions to support the protection of AWS
assets, communication of incidents or events that impact Amazon assets and/or customers to AWS
(Control AWSCA-5.11). In addition, AWS provides monitoring of adherence with security and operational
standards by performing periodic reviews of colocation service providers (Control AWSCA-5.12). The
frequency of colocation reviews is based on a tiering that is dependent on the contracts and level of
engagement with the colocation service provider.

AWS spaces within colocation facilities are installed with AWS-operated CCTV, intrusion detection
systems, and access control devices that alert AWS personnel of access and incidents. Physical access to
AWS spaces within colocation facilities is controlled by AWS and follows standard AWS access
management processes.

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

# Redundancy

Data centers are designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels. Each AWS Region is comprised of multiple data centers. All data centers are online and serving traffic; no data center is “cold.” In case of failure, automated processes move traffic away from the affected area. Core applications are deployed to an N+1 standard, so that in the event of a data center failure, there is sufficient capacity to enable traffic to be load-balanced to the remaining sites.

# Fire Detection and Suppression

Automatic fire detection and suppression equipment has been installed to reduce risk. The fire detection system utilizes smoke detection sensors in Amazon-owned data center environments (e.g., VESDA, point source detection), mechanical and electrical infrastructure spaces, chiller rooms, and generator equipment rooms. These areas are protected by either wet-pipe, double-interlocked pre-action, or gaseous sprinkler systems (Control AWSCA-5.7).

# Power

The data center electrical power systems supporting AWS are designed to be fully redundant and maintainable without impact to operations, 24 hours a day, and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units provide back-up power in the event of an electrical failure for critical and essential loads in Amazon-owned data centers and third-party colocation sites where Amazon maintains the UPS units. Amazon-owned data centers use generators to provide back-up power for the facility (Control AWSCA-5.9 and AWSCA-5.10).

# Climate and Temperature

Climate control is required to maintain a constant operating temperature for servers and other hardware, which prevents overheating and reduces the possibility of service outages. Amazon-owned data centers are conditioned to maintain atmospheric conditions at specified levels. Personnel and systems monitor and control temperature and humidity at appropriate levels. This is provided at N+1 and also utilizes free cooling as primary source of cooling when and where it is available based on local environmental conditions (Control AWSCA-5.8).

# Environment Management

In Amazon-owned data centers, AWS monitors electrical, mechanical, and life support systems and equipment so that any issues are immediately identified. This is carried out by utilizing the Continuous Audit Tool (CAT) for daily rounds and readings, in tandem with an overview of our data centers provided via AWS’ Building Management System (BMS) and Electrical Monitoring System (EMS). Preventative maintenance is performed to maintain the continued operability of equipment utilizing the Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) tool and trouble ticketing and change management system. The primary objective of this program is to provide a holistic insight into Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing (MEP) Assets owned by AWS infrastructure teams. This includes providing a centralized repository for equipment, optimizing planned and unplanned maintenance and managing data center critical spare parts.

# Management of Media

When a storage device has reached the end of its useful life, AWS procedures include a decommissioning process that is designed to prevent unauthorized access to assets. AWS uses techniques detailed in NIST 800-88 (“Guidelines for Media Sanitization”) as part of the decommissioning process. All production media is securely decommissioned in accordance with industry-standard practices (Control AWSCA-5.13). Production media is not removed from AWS control until it has been securely decommissioned.

# AWS Change Management Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

# D.7 Change Management

AWS applies a systematic approach to managing changes so that changes to customer impacting services are reviewed, tested, approved, and well communicated. Change management processes are based on Amazon change management guidelines and tailored to the specifics of each AWS service (Control AWSCA-6.1). These processes are documented and communicated to the necessary personnel by service team management.

The goal of AWS’ change management process is to prevent unintended service disruptions and maintain the integrity of service to the customer. Change details are documented in one of Amazon’s change management or deployment tools (Control AWSCA-6.2).

Prior to deployment to production environments, changes are:

- Developed: in a development environment that is segregated from the production environment (Control AWSCA-6.4). Customer content is not used in test and development environments.
- Reviewed: by peers for technical aspects and appropriateness (Control AWSCA-6.5).
- Tested: to confirm the changes will behave as expected when applied and not adversely impact performance (Control AWSCA-6.3).
- Approved: by authorized team members to provide appropriate oversight and understanding of business impact (Control AWSCA-6.5).

Changes are typically pushed into production in a phased deployment starting with lowest impact sites. Deployments are closely monitored so impact can be evaluated. Service owners have a number of configurable metrics that measure the health of the service’s upstream dependencies. These metrics are closely monitored with thresholds and alarming in place (e.g., latency, availability, fatal errors, CPU utilization, etc.). Customer information, including personal information, and customer content are not used in test and development environments (Control AWSCA-6.7). Rollback procedures are documented so that team members can revert back to the previous state if needed.

When possible, changes are scheduled during regular change windows. Emergency changes to production systems that require deviations from standard change management procedures are associated with an incident and are logged and approved as appropriate.

AWS performs deployment validations and change reviews to detect unauthorized changes to its environment and tracks identified issues to resolution. On a monthly basis, as part of the AWS Security Assurance business review, AWS management reviews and tracks deployment violations for services enrolled in the Deployment Monitoring program. For those services not enrolled in the Deployment Monitoring program, a secondary monthly review of deployments is conducted within 60 days of the month in which they were made. If any unauthorized changes are detected or deviates from the standard review and approval process, they are tracked to resolution (Control AWSCA-6.6).

# Infrastructure

AWS internally developed configuration management software is installed when new hardware is.

#

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Provisioned tools are run on all UNIX hosts to validate configuration and software installation based on host classes and updated regularly.

Only approved users with verified business needs are authorized to log in to central configuration management servers. Host configuration settings are monitored for compliance with AWS security standards and automatically pushed to the host fleet.

Emergency, non-routine, and other configuration changes to existing AWS infrastructure are authorized, logged, tested, approved, and documented following industry norms. Updates are performed to minimize impact on customers, with communication through email or the AWS Health Dashboard.

# Data Integrity, Availability, Redundancy, and Data Retention

AWS maintains data integrity through all phases including transmission, storage, and processing. Amazon S3 uses checksums internally to ensure data integrity in transit and at rest. Data retention is in place until customer removal or agreement termination.

AWS Resiliency Program addresses major availability events with proactive risk mitigation strategies, including separate Availability Zones and continuous infrastructure capacity planning.

Contingency plans and incident response playbooks are regularly updated to reflect emerging risks and past incidents.

#

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Through the due course of business, the AWS Resiliency Plan is tested, reviewed, and approved by senior leadership annually (Control AWSCA-10.3).

AWS has identified critical system components required to maintain availability and recover service in case of an outage. Critical system components are backed up across multiple isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone operates on its own physically distinct infrastructure, engineered for high reliability. Common points of failure are not shared across Availability Zones, ensuring resilience even in the face of uncommon disasters like fires, tornados, or flooding. AWS replicates critical system components across multiple Availability Zones and maintains authoritative backups to ensure successful replication (Control AWSCA-10.1 and AWSCA-10.2).

# Data Backup

AWS core storage services can be redundantly stored in multiple physical locations as part of normal operations. Customers can enable backups of their data across AWS services.

Amazon S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a year. Objects are redundantly stored on multiple devices across facilities in an Amazon S3 region. Amazon S3 ensures durability by synchronously storing customer content across multiple facilities, maintaining object integrity through checksums and repairing lost redundancy (Control AWSCA-7.3, AWSCA-7.4, and AWSCA-7.5).

Amazon EBS replication is stored within the same availability zone, but customers can take regular snapshots to Amazon S3 for long-term data durability. Backups to Amazon S3 can be performed through the database management system for complex transactional databases using Amazon EBS (Control AWSCA-7.6).

Amazon RDS offers automated backups and database snapshots for customer DB Instances, enabling point-in-time recovery and user-initiated backups. The automatic backup feature stores databases and transaction logs for a user-specified retention period, allowing restoration to any second within the defined period. DB Snapshots are full database backups that customers can create new DB Instances from (Control AWSCA-7.6).

# SOC-2 Compliance Report Parsing Instruction

Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS continuously monitors service usage to project infrastructure needs to support availability commitments and requirements. AWS maintains a capacity planning model to assess infrastructure usage and demands at least monthly, and usually more frequently (e.g., weekly). In addition, the AWS capacity planning model supports the planning of future demands to acquire and implement additional resources based upon current resources and forecasted requirements (Control AWSCA-10.4).

Confidentiality

AWS is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of its customers’ content, defined as “Your Content” at https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/ (Control AWSCA-11.3). AWS’ systems and services are designed to enable authenticated AWS customers to access and manage their content. AWS notifies customers of third-party access to a customer’s content on the third-party access page located at https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/third-party-access. AWS may remove a customer’s content when compelled to do so by a legal order, or where there is evidence of fraud or abuse as described in the Customer Agreement (https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) and Acceptable Use Policy (https://aws.amazon.com/aup/). In executing the removal of a customer’s content due to the reasons stated above, employees may render it inaccessible as the situation requires. For clarity, this capability to render customer content inaccessible extends to encrypted content as well.

In the course of AWS system and software design, build, and test of product features, a customer’s content is not used and remains in the production environment. A customer’s content is not required for the AWS software development life cycle. When content is required for the development or test of a service’s software, AWS service teams have tools to generate mock, random data.

AWS knows customers care about privacy and data security. That is why AWS gives customers ownership and control over their content by design through tools that allow customers to determine where their content is stored, secure their content in transit or at rest, and manage access to AWS services and resources. AWS also implements technical and physical controls designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of a customer’s content. As described in the Physical Security and Change Management areas in Section III of this report, AWS employs a number of controls to safeguard data from within and outside of the boundaries of environments which store a customer’s content. As a result of these measures, access to a customer’s content is restricted to authorized parties.

AWS contingency plans and incident response playbooks have defined and tested tools and processes to detect, mitigate, investigate, and assess security incidents. These plans and playbooks include guidelines for responding to potential data breaches in accordance with contractual and regulatory requirements. AWS security engineers follow a protocol when responding to potential data security incidents. The protocol involves steps, which include validating the presence of customer content within the AWS service (without actually viewing the data), determining the encryption status of a customer’s content, and determining improper access to a customer’s content to the extent possible.

During the course of their response, the security engineers document relevant findings in internal tools used to track the security issue. AWS Security Leadership is regularly apprised of all data security issue investigations. In the event there are positive indicators that customer content was potentially accessed by an unintended party, a security engineer engages AWS Security Leadership and the AWS Legal team to review the findings. AWS Security Leadership and the Legal team review the findings and determine if a

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

In connection with that customer's account, and any computational results that a customer or any end user derives from the foregoing through their use of AWS services. For example, customer content includes content that a customer or any end user stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). The terms of the AWS Customer Agreement (https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) and AWS Service Terms (https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) apply to customer content.

Account information is information about a customer that a customer provides to AWS in connection with the creation or administration of a customer account. For example, account information includes names, user names, phone numbers, email addresses, and billing information associated with a customer account. Any information submitted by the customer that AWS needs in order to provide services to the customer or in connection with the administration of customer accounts, is not in-scope for this report.

The AWS Privacy Notice is available from the AWS website at https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/. The AWS Privacy Notice is reviewed by the AWS Legal team, and is updated as required to reflect Amazon’s current business practices and global regulatory requirements. The Privacy Notice describes how AWS collects and uses a customer’s personal information in relation to AWS websites, applications, products, services, events, and experiences. The Privacy Notice does not apply to customer content.

As part of the AWS account creation and activation process, AWS customers are informed of the AWS Privacy Notice and are required to accept the Customer Agreement, including the terms and conditions related to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of their data. Customers are responsible for determining what content to store within AWS, which may include personal information. Without the acceptance of the Customer Agreement, customers cannot sign up to use the AWS services.

The AWS Customer Agreement informs customers of the AWS data security and privacy commitments prior to activating an AWS account and is made available to customers to review at any time on the AWS website (Control AWSCA-12.1).

The customer determines what data is entered into AWS services and has the ability to configure the appropriate security and privacy settings for the data, including who can access and use the data. Further, the customer is able to choose not to provide certain data. Additionally, the customer manages notification or consent requirements, and maintains the accuracy of the data.

Additionally, the AWS Customer Agreement notes how AWS shares, secures, and retains customer content. AWS also informs customers of updates to the Customer Agreement by making it available on its website and providing the last updated date. Customers should check the Customer Agreement website frequently for any changes to the Customer Agreement (Control AWSCA-12.2).

AWS does not store any customer cardholder data obtained from customers. Rather, AWS passes the customer cardholder data and sends it immediately to the Amazon Payments Platform, the PCI-certified platform that Amazon uses for all payment processing. This platform returns a unique identifier that AWS stores and uses for all future processing. The Amazon Payments Platform sits completely outside of the AWS boundary and is run by the larger Amazon entity. It is not an AWS service, but it is utilized by the larger Amazon entity for payment processing. As such, the Amazon payment platform is not in-scope for this report.

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS offers customers the ability to update their communication preferences through the AWS console
or via the AWS Email Preference Center (Control AWSCA-12.3). When customers update their
communication preferences using their email, their updated preferences are saved. Customers can
unsubscribe from AWS marketing emails within the AWS console. AWS Customers will still receive
important account-related notifications from AWS, such as monthly billing statements, or if there are
significant changes to a service that customers use.

AWS provides authenticated customers the ability to access, update, and confirm their data. Denial of
access will be communicated using the AWS console (Control AWSCA-12.6). Customers can sign into to
their AWS accounts through the AWS console to view and update their data.

AWS (or Amazon) does not disclose customer information in response to government demands unless
we're required to do so to comply with a legally valid and binding order. AWS Legal reviews and maintains
records of all the information requests, which lists information on the types and volume of information
requested. Unless AWS is prohibited from doing so or there is clear indication of illegal conduct in
connection with the use of Amazon products or services, AWS notifies customers before disclosing
customer content so they can seek protection from disclosure. AWS shares customer content only as
described in the AWS Customer Agreement.

AWS may produce non-content and/or content information in response to valid and binding law
enforcement and governmental requests, such as subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants. “Non-
content information” means customer information such as name, address, email address, billing
information, date of account creation, and service usage information. “Content information” includes the
content that a customer transfers for processing, storage, or hosting in connection with AWS services and
any computational results. AWS records customer information requests to maintain a complete, accurate,
and timely record of such requests (Control AWSCA-12.7).

If required, customers are responsible for providing notice to the individuals whose data the customer
collects and uses within AWS. AWS is not responsible for providing such notice to or obtaining consent
from these individuals and is only responsible for communicating its privacy commitments to AWS
customers, which is provided during the account creation and activation process.

AWS has documented an incident response policy and plan which outlines an organized approach for
responding to security breaches and incidents. The AWS Security team is responsible for monitoring
systems, tracking issues, and documenting findings of security-related events. Records are maintained for
security breaches and incidents, which includes status information required for supporting forensic
activities, trend analysis, and evaluation of incident details.

As part of the process, potential breaches of customer content are investigated and escalated to AWS
Security and AWS Legal. Affected customers and regulators are notified of breaches and incidents where
legally required. Customers can subscribe to the AWS Security Bulletins page, which provides information
regarding identified security issues. AWS notifies affected customers and regulators of breaches and
incidents as legally required in accordance with team processes (Control AWSCA-12.5).

AWS retains and disposes of customer content in accordance with the Customer Agreement and the AWS
Data Classification and Handling Policy. When a customer terminates their account or contract with AWS,
the account is put under isolation; after which within 90 days, customers can restore their accounts and

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS services hosting customer content are designed to retain customer content until the contractual obligation to retain a customer’s content ends or a customer-initiated action to remove or delete the content is taken (Control AWSCA-7.8). When a customer requests data to be deleted, AWS utilizes automated processes to detect that request and make the content inaccessible. After the deletion is complete, automated actions are taken on deleted content to render the content unreadable (Control AWSCA-7.7).

AWS performs application security reviews for Third-Party systems that integrate with AWS, to ascertain security risks are identified and mitigated (Control AWSCA-12.4). A typical security review considers privacy components, such as retention period, use, and collection of data as applicable. The review starts with a system owner initiating a review request to the dedicated AWS Vendor Security (AVS) team, and submitting detailed information about the artifacts being reviewed. A Security review is required if an AWS Team engages with a new external party for collecting data or modifications to existing systems.

During this process, the AVS team determines the granularity of review required based on the artifact’s design, threat model, and impact to AWS’ risk profile. They provide security guidance, validate security assurance material, and meet with external parties to discuss their penetration tests, Software Development Life Cycle, change management processes, and other operating security controls. They work with the system owner to identify, prioritize, and remediate security findings. The AVS team collaborates with AWS Legal as needed to validate that changes are in-line with AWS privacy policies. The AVS team provides their final approval for the third-party system after they have adequately assessed the risks and worked with the requester to implement security controls to mitigate identified risks.

# Monitoring

# Monitoring Activities

AWS utilizes a wide variety of automated monitoring systems to provide a high level of service performance and availability. AWS defines a Security Incident as a security-related adverse event in which there was a loss of data confidentiality, disruption of data or systems integrity, or disruption or denial of availability. AWS monitoring tools are implemented to detect unusual or unauthorized activities and conditions at ingress and egress communication points. These tools monitor server and network usage, port scanning activities, application usage, and unauthorized intrusion attempts.

Systems within AWS are further designed to monitor key operational metrics and alarms are configured to automatically notify operations and management personnel when early warning thresholds are crossed. An on-call schedule is used such that personnel are always available to respond to operational issues. This includes a pager system, so that notifications are quickly and reliably communicated to operations personnel (Control AWSCA-8.1).

Documentation is maintained to aid and inform operations personnel in handling incidents or issues. A ticketing system is used which supports communication, progress updates, necessary collaboration between teams, and logging capabilities. Trained call leaders facilitate communication and progress during the handling of operational issues that require collaboration. After action reviews are convened following any significant operational issue, regardless of external impact, and Correction of Errors (COE) documents are composed such that the root cause is captured and preventative actions may be taken for

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

The AWS Security Operations team employs industry-standard diagnosis procedures to drive resolution during business-impacting events. Staff operators provide 24 x 7 x 365 coverage to detect incidents and manage the impact and resolution.

AWS monitors resourcing and staffing through an annual assessment of employee qualification alignment with entity objectives. Management and employees evaluate performance over the last year, set goals for the next year, and review operational plans and goals for the coming period.

# Incident Notification

AWS has documented an incident response policy and plan for responding to security breaches and incidents. The AWS Security team monitors systems, tracks issues, and documents findings of security-related events. Records are maintained for security breaches and incidents, including status information, forensic activities, trend analysis, and evaluation of incident details.

Potential breaches of customer content are investigated and escalated to AWS Security and AWS Legal. Affected customers and regulators are notified of breaches and incidents where legally required. Customers can subscribe to the AWS Security Bulletins page for information regarding identified security issues.

# Complementary User Entity Controls

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section IV – Description of Criteria, AWS Controls, Tests and Results of Tests

# Testing Performed and Results of Entity-Level Controls

In planning the nature, timing and extent of testing of the controls, EY considered the aspects of AWS’ control environment and tested those controls that were considered necessary.

In addition to the tests of operating effectiveness of specific controls described below, procedures included tests of the following components of the internal control environment of AWS:

- Management controls and organizational structure
- Risk assessment process
- Information and communication
- Control activities
- Monitoring

Tests of the control environment included various procedures such as a review of AWS’ organizational structure, discussions with management and personnel, and observations of personnel in the performance of their duties.

The control environment was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of the testing of controls relevant to the achievement of service commitments and system requirements.

# Procedures for Assessing Completeness and Accuracy of Information Provided by the Entity (IPE)

For tests of controls requiring the use of IPE, EY performed procedures to address the completeness, accuracy, and data integrity of the data or reports used. This included inspecting the source of the IPE, tying data between the IPE and the source, and inspecting the IPE for anomalies.

Additionally, for tests of controls requiring management’s use of IPE, EY inspected management’s procedures to assess the validity of the IPE source and the completeness, accuracy, and integrity of the data or reports.

# Trust Services Criteria and Related Controls for Systems and Applications

The applicable Trust Services criteria and controls to achieve service commitments and system requirements are specified by AWS. The “Tests Performed by EY” and the “Results of Tests” are the responsibility of the service auditor.

Note: A comparison of revised AWS controls during the examination period is provided in Section V of this report, “Other Information Provided By Amazon Web Services” for informational purposes.

# SOC Control Adjustment Overview

The section below provides an overview of the key changes to SOC controls that occurred during the Fall 2023 (10/01/2022 - 9/30/2023) reporting period from previous reports.

# Section I: Modifications to existing controls

|OLD – Fall 2022|NEW – Spring 2023|
|---|---|
|AWSCA-4.5: KMS-Specific – KMS keys used for cryptographic operations in KMS are logically secured so that no single AWS employee can gain access to the key material.|AWSCA-4.5: KMS-Specific – KMS keys used for cryptographic operations in KMS are logically secured so that no AWS employee can gain access to the key material.|

Rationale: In an effort of continuous improvement, AWS updates the report to reflect its most current process documentation. The previous control language implied that multiple AWS employees in quorum can access the key material which is not the case. No significant change to the control design and operation.

# Appendix – Glossary of Terms

# Appendix – Glossary of Terms

AMI: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an encrypted machine image stored in Amazon S3. It contains all the information necessary to boot instances of a customer’s software.

API: Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface in computer science that defines the ways by which an application program may request services from libraries and/or operating systems.

Authentication: Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be.

Availability Zone: Amazon EC2 locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones and provide inexpensive, low latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same region.

Bucket: A container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is contained within a bucket. More information can be found in Amazon S3 Basics.

AWS Content: “AWS Content” means Content we or any of our affiliates make available in connection with the Services or on the AWS Site to allow access to and use of the Services, including APIs; WSDLs; Documentation; sample code; software libraries; command line tools; roofs of concept; templates; and other related technology (including any of the foregoing that are provided by our personnel). AWS Content does not include the Services or Third-Party Content.

Customer Content: Defined as “Your Content” in AWS Customer Agreement.

HMAC: In cryptography, a keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC or KHMAC), is a type of message authentication code (MAC) calculated using a specific algorithm involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key. As with any MAC, it may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message. Any iterative cryptographic hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1, accordingly. The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, on the size and quality of the key and the size of the hash output length in bits.

Personal Information: Personal information that AWS collects in the course of providing AWS’ offerings include:
- Information You Give Us: We collect any information you provide in relation to AWS Offerings. Click here to see examples of information you give us.
- Automatic Information: We automatically collect certain types of information when you interact with AWS Offerings. Click here to see examples of information we collect automatically.
- Information from Other Sources: We might collect information about you from other sources, including service providers, partners, and publicly available sources. Click here to see examples of information we collect from other sources.

# Appendix – Glossary of Terms

# Appendix – Glossary of Terms

Hypervisor:
A hypervisor, also called Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is computer software/hardware virtualization software that allows multiple operating systems to run on a host computer concurrently.

IP Address:
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical label that is assigned to devices participating in a computer network utilizing the Internet Protocol for communication between its nodes.

IP Spoofing:
Creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a forged source IP address, called spoofing, with the purpose of concealing the identity of the sender or impersonating another computing system.

MD5 checksums:
In cryptography, MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value. As an Internet standard (RFC 1321), MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files.

Object:
The fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object data and metadata. The data portion is opaque to Amazon S3. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These include some default metadata such as the date last modified and standard HTTP metadata such as Content-Type. The developer can also specify custom metadata at the time the Object is stored.

Port Scanning:
A port scan is a series of messages sent by someone attempting to break into a computer to learn which computer network services, each associated with a “well-known” port number, the computer provides.

Privacy Policy:
“Privacy Policy” means the privacy policy located at https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/ (and any successor or related locations designated by us), as it may be updated by AWS from time to time.

User entity:
The entities that use the services of a service organization during some or all of the review period.

Service:
Software or computing ability provided across a network (e.g., Amazon EC2, Amazon S3).

Service Organization:
An organization or segment of an organization that provides services to user entities that are likely to be relevant to those user entities’ internal control over financial reporting.

Signature Version 4:
Signature Version 4 is the process to add authentication information to AWS requests. For security, most requests to AWS must be signed with an access key, which consists of an access key ID and secret access key.

Subservice Organization:
A service organization used by another service organization to perform some of the services provided to user entities that are likely to be relevant to those user entities’ internal control over financial reporting.

Virtual Instance:
Once an AMI has been launched, the resulting running system is referred to as a virtual instance. All instances based on the same AMI start out identical and any information on them is lost when the instances are terminated or fail.

X.509:
In cryptography, X.509 is an ITU-T standard for a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for Single Sign-On (SSO) and Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI). X.509 specifies, among other things, standard formats for public key certificates, certificate revocation lists, attribute certificates and a certification path validation algorithm.

Opinion:

In our opinion, in all material respects:

- The Description presents the Amazon Web Services system that was designed and implemented throughout the period October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023, in accordance with the Description Criteria.
- The controls stated in the Description were suitably designed throughout the period October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023, to provide reasonable assurance that AWS's service commitments and system requirements would be achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria.

Description of tests of controls:

The specific controls we tested and the nature, timing, and results of those tests are listed in the accompanying "Description of Criteria: AWS Controls, Tests, and Results of Tests" (Description of Tests and Results).

Inherent limitations:

The Description is prepared to meet the common needs of a broad range of users and may not include every aspect of the system that each individual user may consider important to meet their informational needs.

There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of controls. Controls at a service organization may not always operate effectively to provide reasonable assurance that the service organization's service commitments and system requirements are achieved based on the applicable trust services criteria. Also, the projection to the future of any evaluation of the presentation of the Description, conclusions about the suitability of the design or operating effectiveness of the controls to meet the applicable trust services criteria, is subject to the risk that the system may change or that controls at a service organization may become ineffective.

EY

Moving the customer’s IT infrastructure to AWS builds a shared responsibility model between customers and AWS. AWS operates, manages, and controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. In turn, customers assume responsibility and management of the design, implementation and operation of their AWS environment, which may include guest operating systems (including updates and security patches), other associated application software, as well as the configuration of the AWS-provided security group firewall. Customers should carefully consider the services they choose as customer responsibilities vary depending on the services they use, the integration of those services into their IT environments, and applicable laws and regulations. It is possible to enhance security and/or meet more stringent compliance requirements by leveraging technology such as host-based firewalls, host-based intrusion detection/prevention, and encryption. AWS provides tools and information to assist customers in their efforts to account for and to validate that controls are operating effectively in their extended IT environment. More information can be found on the AWS Compliance center at https://aws.amazon.com/compliance.

AWS offers a variety of different infrastructure and platform services. More information can be found on the AWS Shared Responsibility Model at https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/. For the purpose of understanding security and shared responsibility for AWS’ services, AWS has categorized them into three main categories: infrastructure, container, and abstracted. Each category comes with a slightly different security ownership model based on how customers interact and access the functionality. Customer responsibility is determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities.

# Infrastructure Services:

Services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) are categorized as Infrastructure Services and, as such, require the customer to perform the necessary security configuration and management tasks. If a customer deploys an Amazon EC2 instance, they are responsible for management of the guest operating system (including updates and security patches).

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Security patches), any application software or utilities installed by the customer on the instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a security group) on each instance.

Container Services: Services in this category typically run separately on Amazon EC2 or other infrastructure instances, but sometimes customers are not required to manage the operating system or the platform layer. AWS provides a managed service for these application “containers”. Customers are responsible for setting up and managing network controls, such as firewall rules, and for managing platform-level identity and access management separately from IAM. Examples of container services include Amazon Relational Database Services (Amazon RDS), Amazon Elastic Map Reduce (Amazon EMR) and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Abstracted Services: This category includes high-level storage, database, and messaging services, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), Amazon Glacier, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Queuing Service (Amazon SQS), and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES). These services abstract the platform or management layer on which the customers can build and operate cloud applications. The customers access the endpoints of these abstracted services using AWS APIs, and AWS manages the underlying service components or the operating system on which they reside.

As every customer deploys their environment differently in AWS, customers can take advantage of shifting the management of certain IT controls to AWS, which results in a (new) distributed control environment. Customers can then use the AWS control and compliance documentation available to them to perform their control evaluation and verification procedures as required. Certain functions of services have been identified as controls in the system description and are denoted as “service-specific” as they are unique to the respective service.

More information and examples on the AWS Security Best Practices can be found at AWS Security Best Practices.

Furthermore, AWS publishes security blogs related to best practices that cover best practices around using AWS services at AWS Security Blogs.

# Relevant Aspects of Internal Controls

As defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), internal control is a process affected by an entity’s board of directors, management, and other personnel and consists of five interrelated components:

- Control Environment – Sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control consciousness of its people. It is the foundation for all other components of internal control, providing discipline and structure.
- Risk Assessment – The entity’s identification and analysis of relevant risks to the achievement of its objectives, forming a basis for determining how the risks should be managed.
- Information and Communication – Surrounding these activities are information and communication systems. These enable the entity’s people to capture and exchange information needed to conduct and control its operations.

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Monitoring – The entire process must be monitored, and modifications made as necessary. In this way, the system can react dynamically, changing as conditions warrant.

Control Activities – Control policies and procedures must be established and executed to help ensure that the actions identified by management as necessary to address risks to the achievement of the entity’s objectives are effectively carried out.

This section briefly describes the essential characteristics and other interrelated components of internal controls in achieving the service commitments and system requirements for the applicable trust services criteria of security, availability, confidentiality, and privacy as they pertain to AWS that may be relevant to customers in five broad areas:

- Policies (Control Environment and Risk Management) – The entity has defined and documented its policies relevant to the applicable trust services criteria.
- Communications (Information and Communication) – The entity has communicated its defined policies to responsible parties and authorized users of the system.
- Service Commitments and System Requirements (Control Activities) – The entity has communicated its service commitments and system requirements to customers in accordance with customer agreements.
- Procedures (Control Activities) – The entity has placed in operation procedures to achieve service commitments and systems requirements in accordance with its defined policies.
- Monitoring – The entity monitors the system and takes action to maintain compliance with its defined policies.

# A. Policies

# A.1 Control Environment

AWS is a unit within Amazon.com (“Amazon” or “the Company”) that is aligned organizationally around each of the web services, such as Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon VPC, Amazon EBS and Amazon RDS. AWS leverages some aspects of Amazon’s overall control environment in the delivery of these web services. The collective control environment encompasses management and employee efforts to establish and maintain an environment that supports the effectiveness of specific controls. AWS maintains internal informational websites describing the AWS environment, its boundaries, user responsibilities and services (Control AWSCA-9.1).

The control environment at Amazon begins at the highest level of the Company. Executive and senior leadership play important roles in establishing the Company’s core values and tone at the top. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, which sets guiding principles, is made available to every employee.

Amazon is committed to having the highest qualified members as a part of its Board of Directors (Control AWSCA-1.7). Annually, the Amazon Corporate Governance Committee provides each Board member a questionnaire that establishes whether they are independent and qualified to serve on each Board or Committee under the applicable rules. The Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews and assesses the composition of the Board and evaluates the overall Board performance during the annual

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS is committed to protecting its customers’ data and maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. This is demonstrated by the consolidated annual operational plan that includes regulatory and compliance requirements and objectives to enable the identification and assessment of risks relating to those objectives (Control AWSCA-1.9). AWS’ policies and procedures outline the required guidance for operation and information security that supports AWS environments, acceptable use of mobile devices, and access to data content and network devices (Control AWSCA-3.16). All AWS employees are required to review all applicable policies and procedures, as updated from time to time. Evidence of compliance with the training on AWS policies is executed and retained by the employee resource team.

Amazon has setup an ethics hotline for the employees or third-party contractors to report any misconduct or violation of AWS policies, practices, rules, requirements or procedures (Control AWSCA-9.6). Any material violation of the Company Code of Business Conduct and Ethics or any other similar policies are appropriately handled accordingly which may include disciplinary action or termination of employment. Violations by vendors or third-party contractors are reported to their employers for disciplinary action, removal of assignment with Amazon, or termination (Control AWSCA-9.7).

AWS Management has implemented a formal audit program that monitors and audits controls that are designed to protect against organizational risks and customer content. This includes external independent assessments against regulatory, internal and external control frameworks. The internal and external audits are planned, performed and reported to the Audit Committee. The AWS compliance team performs and reviews the audit plan according to the documented audit schedule and communicates the audit requirements based on standard criteria that verifies compliance with the regulatory requirements and reported risk to the Audit Committee.

AWS Artifact is the primary resource for customers to obtain compliance-related information from AWS. It provides access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements. Reports available in AWS Artifact include: AWS Service System and Organization Controls (SOC) reports, Payment Card Industry (PCI) Attestation of Compliance, and certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and industry verticals that validate the implementation and operating effectiveness of AWS security controls. Amongst other things, compliance reports are made available to customers to enable them to evaluate AWS’ conformance with security controls and associated compliance obligations (Control AWSCA-9.8).

The AWS organizational structure provides a framework for planning, executing and controlling business operations (Control AWSCA-1.1). The organizational structure assigns roles and responsibilities to provide for adequate staffing, efficiency of operations and the segregation of duties. Management has also established authority and appropriate lines of reporting for key personnel. The Company follows a structured on-boarding process to assist new employees as they become familiar with Amazon tools, processes, systems, policies and procedures.

# AWS SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS performs a formal evaluation of the appropriate resourcing and staffing to align employee qualifications with the entity’s business objectives to support the achievement of the entity’s business objectives. Appropriate feedback is given to the employee on strengths and growth areas during the annual performance review process. Employee strength and growth evaluations are shared by the employee’s manager with the employee (Control AWSCA-9.3).

The GovCloud (US East) and GovCloud (US West) environments are AWS regions located in the United States (US) that are designed to maintain physical and logical access controls that limit access by AWS personnel to the AWS Network for the GovCloud (US) regions to US citizens. The AWS control environment described in this document is also applicable to the GovCloud (US) regions. The AWS control environment is subject to various internal and external risk assessments.

AWS has established an information security framework and regularly reviews and updates the security policies, provides security training, which includes data classification, to employees, and performs application security reviews. These reviews assess the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of data, as well as conformance to the security policies. Where necessary, AWS Security leverages the security framework and security policies established and maintained by Amazon Corporate Information Security.

AWS has a process in place to review environmental and geo-political risks before launching a new region (Control AWSCA-1.10). Risk assessments encompass reviews of natural catastrophe (e.g., extreme weather events), technological (e.g., fire, nuclear radiation, industrial pollution) and man-made (e.g., vehicle impact, intentional acts, geo-political) hazards, including exposures presented by nearby entities; as applicable. In addition to site-specific considerations, AWS evaluates scenarios potentially affecting separate AZs within a region.

# Risk Management

AWS maintains a formal risk management program to identify, analyze, treat, and continuously monitor and report risks that affect AWS’ business objectives, regulatory requirements, and customers. The AWS Risk Management (ARM) program identifies risks, documents them in a risk register, and reports results to leadership at least semi-annually. The risk management program consists of the following phases:

1. # Identifying Risks

ARM has developed a tailored approach to identifying risks across the business. The approach is:

- Bottom-up to identify existing risk management activities
- Top down to gather information from key leaders
- Cross-functional Kaizen sessions intended to deep dive in areas of need

Where appropriate, ARM conducts ad-hoc engagements with the business prompted by inbound requests or proactive outreach by the team on specific questions.
2. # Analyzing Risks

ARM reviews the identified risks with senior leaders to calibrate, assess, and prioritize. This is accomplished by evaluating:

- Probability (likelihood of occurrence in a defined time period)

#

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

3) Treating Risks

ARM adopts risk treatment (versus risk mitigation) as a strategy, collaborating with business SMEs to develop response plans based on the appropriate treatment option. These might include:

- Eliminating or avoiding the risk (e.g., stopping the activity)
- Reducing the risk (e.g., implementing controls)
- Transferring the risk (e.g., to a third party)
- Accepting the risk (when capacity and appetite exist)

4) Monitoring and Reporting Risks

ARM actively monitors material risks and their treatment plans. Reports are provided to senior leadership at least semi-annually. Reports may include important information about key risks and treatments, as well as emerging trends and general program updates (Control AWSCA-1.5).

In addition to the ARM Risk Assessment, Internal Audit performs a separate Risk Assessment to identify and prioritize significant AWS risks and uses this information to define the audit plan. The Risk Assessment incorporates input from multiple sources such as changes to the business, internal audits, operational events, and emerging risks. The audit plan and any changes to the plan during the year are presented to the Audit Committee. Internal Audit also communicates significant audit findings and associated action plans to the Audit Committee.

Additionally, at least on a monthly basis, AWS management reviews the AWS operational metrics and Correction of Errors (COEs) to improve the overall availability of AWS services and to identify areas of improvements while mitigating risks to our environments. The “COE” documents are used to perform deep root cause analysis of certain incidents across AWS, document actions taken, and assign follow-up action items and owners to track to resolution.

# B. Communications

AWS has implemented various methods of internal communication at a global level to help employees understand their individual roles and responsibilities and to communicate significant events in a timely manner. These methods include orientation and training programs for newly hired employees; annual training programs are tailored based on employee roles and responsibilities that may include Amazon Security Awareness (ASA) (Control AWSCA-1.4), Software Developer Engineer (SDE) Bootcamp, ITAR Secure Coding Training, Threat Modeling the Right Way for Amazon Builders Fraud/Bribery/Foreign corrupt practices training, and Privacy Engineering Foundations for AWS Service Teams confidentiality training, Managing Third Parties Using the Third-Party Risk Management Lifecycle, Export Compliance trainings; regular management meetings for updates on business performance and other matters; and electronic means such as video conferencing, electronic mail messages, and the posting of information via the Amazon intranet on topics such as reporting of information security incidents and guidelines.

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Describing change management, the AWS Internal Privacy Policy informs AWS employees and applicable vendors/contractors about AWS’ requirements regarding the privacy of customer’s personal information in accordance with applicable legislation and other AWS obligations.

# Service Commitments and System Requirements

# Service Commitments

AWS communicates service commitments to user entities (AWS customers) in the form of Service Level Agreements (SLAs), customer agreements, contracts, or through the description of the service offerings provided online through the AWS website. More information regarding Service Level Agreements can be found at https://aws.amazon.com/legal/service-level-agreements/.

AWS uses various methods of external communication to support its customer base and the community. Mechanisms are in place to allow the AWS Support Escalation and Event Management (E2M) team to be notified and to notify customers of potential operational issues that could impact the customer experience. AWS Health Dashboard is available to alert customers of “General Service Events” which show the health of all AWS services and “Your Account Events” shows events specific to the account. Current status information can be checked by the customer on this site, or by leveraging Amazon EventBridge Integrations or RSS feeds which allow customers to be notified of interruptions to each individual service. Details related to security and compliance with AWS can also be obtained on the AWS Security Center and AWS Compliance websites.

Customers have the ability to contact AWS through the ‘Contact us’ page for any issues related to the AWS services. AWS provides publicly available mechanisms for external parties to contact AWS to report security events and publishes information including a system description and security and compliance information addressing AWS commitments and responsibilities (Control AWSCA-9.5). Customers can also subscribe to Premium Support offerings that include direct communication with the customer support team and proactive alerts for any customer impacting issues. AWS also deploys monitoring and alarming mechanisms which are configured by AWS Service Owners to identify and notify operational and management personnel of incidents when early warning thresholds are crossed on key operational metrics (Control AWSCA-8.1). Additionally, incidents are logged within a ticketing system, assigned a severity rating and tracked to resolution (Control AWSCA-8.2).

# System Requirements

The selection and use of services by AWS’ customers must be set up and operated under a shared responsibility model so that the functionality of the services and the associated security is appropriately managed. AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs the service(s) offered in the AWS Cloud. The customer’s responsibility is determined by the AWS Cloud service(s) that a customer selects and the interdependencies of those services within the AWS Cloud and their own networked environment. Customers should assess the objectives for their network when designing IT components by identifying the risk and corresponding controls to be implemented to address those risks. Customers should carefully consider the services they choose as their responsibilities vary depending on the.

# SOC-2 Compliance Report

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

When designing and developing its services, AWS management has created internal policies that are relevant to the services and systems available to customers. The development of these policies and procedures supports management with decision making and the operational teams with business requirements and management of each service and system. As each AWS service is unique, the system requirements to use different services vary depending on the service and each customer’s environment.

As explained in the Availability section of the report, AWS has processes and infrastructure in place to make the services available to customers to meet their needs. AWS communicates its system requirements to customers and how to get started with using the AWS services in the form of user guides, developer guides, API references, service specific tutorials, or SDK toolkits. More information regarding the AWS Documentation can be found at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/. These resources help the customers with architecting the AWS services to satisfy their business needs.

AWS has identified the following objectives to support the security, change, and operational processes underlying their service commitments and business requirements. The objectives ensure the system operates and mitigates the risks that threaten the achievement of the service commitments and system requirements. The objectives below provide reasonable assurance that:

- Data integrity is maintained through all phases, including transmission, storage and processing.
- Procedures have been established so that Amazon employee user accounts are added, modified and deleted in a timely manner and reviewed on a periodic basis.
- Policies and mechanisms are in place to appropriately restrict unauthorized internal and external access to data and customer content is appropriately segregated from other customers.
- System incidents are recorded, analyzed and resolved.
- Changes (including emergency/non-routine and configuration) to existing IT resources are logged, authorized, tested, approved and documented.
- Critical system components are replicated across multiple Availability Zones and authoritative backups are maintained and monitored to ensure successful replication to meet the service commitments.
- Controls are implemented to safeguard data from within and outside of the boundaries of environments which store a customer’s content to meet the service commitments.
- Procedures have been established so that the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of customer content within AWS services is in accordance with the service commitments.

# Procedures

# Security Organization

AWS has an established information security organization that is managed by the AWS Security team and is led by the AWS Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). AWS Security team responsibilities are defined.

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

The AWS Security team collaborates with AWS service teams, internal security teams, and external parties to mitigate security risks. They establish and maintain policies and procedures for logical access on the AWS system and infrastructure hosts. These policies define standards for logical access, privacy, and security responsibilities. AWS Security aligns with Amazon Corporate Information Security framework and policies, reviewed and approved annually by AWS Security Leadership to support service commitments to customers.

Key policies inspected in the annual assessment include:

- AWS Access Control Policy
- AWS Media Protection Policy
- AWS Configuration Management Policy
- AWS Password Policy
- AWS Contingency Planning Policy
- AWS Personnel Security Policy
- AWS Critical Permission Group Standard
- Data Center Security Standard: Media Handling, Storage, and Destruction
- Secure Software Development Policy
- AWS Data Classification and Handling Policy
- AWS Security Assessment and Certification Standard
- AWS Facility Badge Management and Use Standard
- AWS Security Awareness Training Policy
- AWS Identification and Authentication Policy
- AWS System and Communications Protection Policy
- AWS Incident Response Policy
- AWS System and Information Integrity Policy
- AWS Information Security Risk Management Policy
- AWS System Maintenance Policy
- AWS Internal Privacy Policy
- AWS Third Party Information Sharing Policy

AWS conducts security awareness and training through an internal communication portal for all employees. The training covers purpose, scope, roles, responsibilities, and management commitment. It includes privacy, data protection, and data handling leading practices. AWS follows the three lines of defense model by the Institute of Internal Auditors, where operational management is the first line of defense, risk control and compliance functions are the second line, and independent assurance is the third.

Note: This information is proprietary and confidential to Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates.

#

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

As its third line of defense, Amazon has an Internal Audit function to periodically evaluate risks and assess conformance to AWS security processes with due professional care (Control AWSCA-9.8). Further, AWS Security Assurance works with third-party assessors to obtain an independent assessment of risk management content/processes by performing periodic security assessments and compliance audits or examinations (e.g., SOC, FedRAMP, ISO, PCI) to evaluate the security, integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information and resources. AWS management also collaborates with Internal Audit to determine the health of the AWS control environment and leverages this information to fairly present the assertions made within the reports.

# D.2 Employee User Access

Procedures exist so that Amazon employee and contractor user accounts are added, modified, or disabled in a timely manner and are reviewed on a periodic basis. In addition, password configuration settings for user authentication to AWS systems are managed in compliance with Amazon’s Password Policy.

AWS has established policies and procedures to delineate standards for logical access to AWS systems and infrastructure hosts. Where permitted by law, AWS requires that employees undergo a background screening, at the time of hiring, commensurate with their position and level of access, in accordance with the AWS Personnel Security Policy (Control AWSCA-9.2). The policies also identify functional responsibilities for the administration of logical access and security.

Additionally, AWS employees who have access to systems that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability, or privacy of customer content are required to complete a post-hire background screening within a year from their last background check. Post-hire screening includes criminal screening requirements consistent with the pre-hire background screening. Access to the systems that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability, or privacy of customer content is managed by membership in permission groups. Employees who support internal services or have access to network resources are not required to complete the post-hire background screening. Post-hire background screening is conducted where it is legally permissible by local law, in accordance with the AWS Personnel Security Policy (Control AWSCA-9.9).

# Account Provisioning

The responsibility for provisioning user access, which includes employee and contractor access is shared across Human Resources (HR), Corporate Operations, and Service Owners.

A standard employee or contractor account with minimum privileges is provisioned in a disabled state when a hiring manager submits his or her new employee or contractor onboarding request in Amazon’s HR system. The account is automatically enabled after the employee’s record is activated in Amazon’s HR system. First time passwords are set to a unique value and are required to be changed on first use (Control AWSCA-2.1).

# Access Management

AWS employs the concept of least privilege, allowing only the necessary access for users to accomplish their job function. User accounts are created to have minimal access. Access above these least privileges requires appropriate and separate authorization.
---
#

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

# Access Control and Permissions

Access to resources including Services, Hosts, Network devices, and Windows and UNIX groups is approved in Amazon’s proprietary permission management system by the appropriate owner or manager. Requests for changes in access are captured in the Amazon permissions management tool audit log. Continued access must be approved when changes in an employee’s job function occur, or it will be automatically revoked (Control AWSCA-2.2).

# Periodic Access Review

Access control lists or permission groups granting access to critical infrastructure are reviewed periodically. AWS conducts quarterly reviews of access to systems supporting the infrastructure and network, requiring explicit re-approval or access revocation. Semi-annual reviews are conducted for access to AWS accounts. Access to operational systems is revoked when a user no longer has a required business need (Control AWSCA-2.3).

# Access Removal

Access is revoked when an employee’s record is terminated in Amazon’s HR system. Windows and UNIX accounts are disabled, and the user is removed from all systems in Amazon’s permission management system (Control AWSCA-2.4).

# Password Policy

Logical security for Amazon relies on user IDs, passwords, and Kerberos for authentication and authorization. AWS Security has established a password policy with required configurations and expiration intervals. A credential monitoring and response process is in place to monitor compromised credentials and rotate impacted user credentials promptly (Control AWSCA-2.5).

# Remote Access

AWS requires two-factor authentication over an approved cryptographic channel for remote access to the internal AWS network (Control AWSCA-2.6).

# Logical Security

Procedures and mechanisms are in place to restrict unauthorized internal and external access to data. Customer content is segregated from other customers, and APIs enable customers to manage access to AWS services and resources they own. AWS prevents unauthorized access to resources and ensures content is only returned to authorized individuals (Control AWSCA-3.5).

# AWS Application Security (AppSec) Reviews

AWS performs Application Security (AppSec) reviews for externally launched products, services, and significant feature additions. The Application Security team collects detailed information for the review, tracks reviews against an inventory, reviews IAM policies, and collaborates with service teams to remediate security findings. Final approval for launch is granted only after completion of the review.

# AWS Network Security

The AWS Network includes internal data center facilities, servers, networking equipment, and host software systems. It provides protection against DDoS attacks, MITM attacks, IP spoofing, and port scanning through various controls and measures.

- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks: AWS API endpoints use proprietary DDoS mitigation techniques and are multi-homed for Internet access diversity.
- Man in the Middle (MITM) Attacks: AWS APIs are available via TLS/SSL-protected endpoints, and EC2 instances generate new SSH host certificates for secure access.
- IP Spoofing: AWS-controlled firewall infrastructure prevents instances from sending traffic with unauthorized IP or MAC addresses.
- Port Scanning: Unauthorized port scans are a violation of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy. Customers can report abuse, and strict security group management helps mitigate port scan threats.

Customers can request permission for vulnerability scans to meet compliance requirements, subject to AWS policies and approval processes.

Packet sniffing by other tenants: Virtual instances are designed to prevent other instances running in promiscuous mode to receive or “sniff” traffic that is intended for a different virtual instance. Customers can encrypt sensitive traffic as standard practice (Control AWSCA-3.10).

Anti-virus software installed on workstations: Anti-virus software is deployed and running on Amazon corporate workstations. Checks are in place to ensure compliance and provide quarantining tooling for non-compliant workstations (Control AWSCA-3.18).

Firewall devices: Configured to restrict access to production networks (Control AWSCA-3.1). Firewall policies are maintained via automatic push from a parent server, with all changes reviewed and approved (Controls AWSCA-3.2, AWSCA-3.3).

Vulnerability scans: Regular scans are performed on host operating systems, web applications, and databases in the AWS environment. AWS Security teams monitor vendor flaws and patches, with customers able to report issues via the AWS Vulnerability Reporting website (Control AWSCA-3.4).

Virtualization techniques: AWS employs virtual networking devices, host-based firewalls, and Access Control Lists (ACLs) in EC2 and VPC to control traffic flow restrictions. Customers are responsible for configuring server resources within the customer VPC.

External Access Control: Customers configure external access to services via AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), enabling secure control over access to AWS services and resources. Security Groups act as firewalls and control access to in-scope applications (Control AWSCA-3.5).

Interacting with the Service: AWS provides various methods of interacting with services, including APIs, SDKs, the AWS Management Console, and the AWS command line interface, all following standard AWS authentication and authorization practices.

Authenticated calls to AWS services are signed by either an X.509 certificate and/or the customer's AWS
Secret Access Key. When using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or one of the AWS SDKs to
make requests to AWS, these tools automatically sign the requests with the access key specified by the
customer when the tools were configured. Manually created requests must be signed using Signature
Version 4 or Signature Version 2. All AWS services support Signature Version 4, except Amazon SimpleDB,
which requires Signature Version 2. For AWS services that support both versions, it is recommended to
use Signature Version 4.

Internal Logging

AWS maintains centralized repositories that provide core log archival functionality available for internal
use by AWS service teams. Leveraging S3 for high scalability, durability, and availability allows service
teams to collect, archive, and view service logs in a central log service.

Production hosts at AWS are deployed using master baseline images (Control AWSCA-9.4). The baseline
images are equipped with a standard set of configurations and functions including logging and monitoring
for security purposes.

These logs are stored and accessible by AWS security teams for root cause analysis in the event of a
suspected security incident. Logs for a given host are also available to the team that owns that host in
case the team needs to search their logs for operational and security analysis.

Encryption

Amazon cryptographic policy defines the appropriate cryptography implementation through the Amazon
cryptographic standard. The cryptography standard is based on FIPS standards, NIST standards, and/or
the Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite (Suite B). Implementation guidance including
appropriate key length and algorithm specific parameters are provided to service teams through
application security reviews. Additionally, AWS Security Engineers within the cryptography review
program review the appropriate use of cryptography within AWS. In addition, API calls can be encrypted
with TLS/SSL to maintain confidentiality. It is the customer’s responsibility to appropriately configure and
manage usage and implementation of available encryption options to meet compliance requirements.

The production firmware version of the AWS Key Management Service HSM (Hardware Security Module)
has been validated with NIST under the latest FIPS 140-2 standard or is in the process of being validated
(Control AWSCA-4.14). The AWS KMS team works with a vendor (Example: Acumen) who in turn works
with NIST to get new HSM firmware versions validated. Every new firmware version that gets deployed
into production goes through the NIST validation process and is submitted to NIST’s Cryptographic Module
Validation Program (CMVP) in order to obtain FIPS 140-2 validation. As the HSM validation process takes
4-6 months to complete, the AWS KMS team initiates the revalidation process with the vendor and may
start deployment while the firmware validation is in process.

# Deletion of Customer Content

AWS provides customers the ability to delete their content. Once successfully removed, the data is rendered unreadable (Control AWSCA-7.7). For services that utilize ephemeral storage, such as EC2, the ephemeral storage is deleted once the EC2 instance is deleted.

# AWS Service Descriptions

# AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify is a set of tools and services that can be used together or on their own, to help front-end web and mobile developers build scalable full stack applications, powered by AWS. With Amplify, customers can configure app backend and connect applications in minutes, deploy static web apps in a few clicks and easily manage app content outside of AWS console. Amplify supports popular web frameworks including JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, Next.js, and mobile platforms including Android, iOS, React Native, Ionic, and Flutter.

# AWS Application Migration Service

AWS Application Migration Service is the primary service that AWS recommends for lift-and-shift applications to AWS. The service minimizes time-intensive, error-prone manual processes by automatically converting customers’ source servers from physical, virtual, or cloud infrastructure to run natively on AWS. Customers are able to use the same automated process to migrate a wide range of applications to AWS without making changes to applications, their architecture, or the migrated servers.

# Amazon API Gateway

# AWS Key Management Service (KMS)

AWS Key Management Service (KMS) allows users to create and manage cryptographic keys. One class of keys, KMS keys, are designed to never be exposed in plaintext outside the service. KMS keys can be used to encrypt data directly submitted to the service. KMS keys can also be used to protect other types of keys, Data Encryption Keys (DEKs), which are created by the service and returned to the user’s application for local use. AWS KMS only creates and returns DEKs to users; the service does not store or manage DEKs.

AWS KMS is integrated with several AWS services so that users can request that resources in those services are encrypted with unique DEKs provisioned by KMS that are protected by a KMS key the user chooses at the time the resource is created (Control AWSCA-4.6). Integrated services use the plaintext DEK from AWS KMS in volatile memory of service-controlled endpoints; they do not store the plaintext DEK to persistent disk. An encrypted copy of the DEK is stored to persistent disk by the service and passed back to AWS KMS for decryption each time the DEK is needed to decrypt content the customer requests. DEKs provisioned by AWS KMS are encrypted with a 256-bit key unique to the customer’s account under a defined mode of AES – Advanced Encryption Standard (Control AWSCA-4.7).

When a customer requests AWS KMS to create a KMS key, the service creates a key ID for the KMS key and (optionally) key material, referred to as a backing key, which is tied to the key ID of the KMS key. The 256-bit backing key can only be used for encrypt or decrypt operations by the service (Control AWSCA-4.10). Customers can choose to have a KMS key ID created and then securely import their own key material to associate with the key ID. If the customer chooses to enable key rotation for a KMS key with a backing key that the service generated, AWS KMS will create a new version of the backing key for each rotation event, but the key ID remains the same (Control AWSCA-4.11). All future encrypt operations under the key ID will use the newest backing key, while all previous versions of backing keys are retained to decrypt ciphertexts created under the previous version of the key. Backing keys and customer-imported keys are encrypted under AWS-controlled keys when created/imported and they are only ever stored on disk in encrypted form.

All requests to AWS KMS APIs are logged and available in the AWS CloudTrail of the requester and the owner of the key. The logged requests provide information about who made the request, under which KMS key, and describes information about the AWS resource that was protected through the use of the

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS KMS creates and manages multiple distributed replicas of KMS keys and key metadata automatically to enable high availability and data durability. KMS keys themselves are regional objects; plaintext versions of the KMS keys can only be used in the AWS region in which they were created. KMS keys are only stored on persistent disk in encrypted form and in two separate storage systems to ensure durability. When a plaintext KMS key is needed to fulfill an authorized customer request, it is retrieved from storage, decrypted on one of many AWS KMS hardened security appliances in the region, then used only in memory to execute the cryptographic operation (e.g., encrypt or decrypt). The plaintext key is then marked for deletion so that it cannot be re-used. Future requests to use the KMS key each require the decryption of the KMS key in memory for another one-time use.

AWS KMS endpoints are only accessible via TLS using specific cipher suites that support forward secrecy:

- ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
- ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256
- ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384
- ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
- ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256
- ECDHE-RSA-3DES-CBC3-SHA
- DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256 (ParamSize: 2048)
- DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 (ParamSize: 2048)
- DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA (ParamSize: 2048)
- DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA (ParamSize: 2048)

By design, no one can gain access to the plaintext KMS key material. Plaintext KMS keys are only ever present on hardened security appliances for the amount of time needed to perform cryptographic operations under them. AWS employees have no tools to retrieve plaintext keys from these hardened security appliances. In addition, multi-party access controls are enforced for operations on these hardened security appliances to minimize unauthorized access or changes to the system.

Key material used for disaster recovery processes by KMS are physically secured to prevent unauthorized access. Access attempts to recovery key materials are reviewed periodically by authorized operators. Roles and responsibilities for cryptographic custodians with access to key material are formally documented and acknowledged.

It provides developers the capability to publish messages from an application and deliver them to subscribers or other applications. Amazon SNS follows the “publish-subscribe” (pub-sub) messaging paradigm, with notifications being delivered to clients using a “push” mechanism. Using SNS requires defining a "Topic", setting policies on access and delivery of the Topic, subscribing consumers and designating delivery endpoints, and publishing messages to a Topic. Administrators define a Topic as an access point for publishing messages and allowing customers to subscribe to notifications. Security policies are applied to Topics to determine who can publish, who can subscribe, and to designate protocols supported.

# Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a message queuing service that offers a distributed hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS, developers can move data between distributed components of their applications that perform different tasks, without losing messages or requiring each component to be always available. Amazon SQS allows customers to build an automated workflow, working in close conjunction with Amazon EC2 and the other AWS infrastructure web services.

Amazon SQS’ main components consist of a frontend request-router fleet, a backend data-storage fleet, a metadata cache fleet, and a dynamic workload management fleet. User queues are mapped to one or more backend clusters. Requests to read, write, or delete messages come into the frontends. The frontends contact the metadata cache to find out which backend cluster hosts that queue and then connect to nodes in that cluster to service the request.

Notifications provide URLs to direct users to resources on the Management Console, to enable further action and remediation.

# Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) enables customers to provision a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where AWS resources can be launched in a virtual network defined by the customer. Customers can connect their existing infrastructure to the network isolated Amazon EC2 instances within their Amazon VPC, including extending their existing management capabilities, such as security services, firewalls and intrusion detection systems, to include their instances via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. The VPN service provides end-to-end network isolation by using an IP address range of a customer’s choice, and routing all of their network traffic between their Amazon VPC and another network designated by the customer via an encrypted Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN.

Customers can optionally connect their VPC to the Internet by adding an Internet Gateway (IGW) or a NAT Gateway. An IGW allows bi-directional access to and from the internet for some instances in the VPC based on the routes a customer defines, which specify which IP address traffic should be routable from the internet, Security Groups, and Network ACLs (NACLS) which limit which instances can accept or send this traffic. Customers can also optionally configure a NAT Gateway which allows egress-only traffic initiated from a VPC instance to reach the internet, but not allow traffic initiated from the internet to reach VPC instances. This is accomplished by mapping the private IP addresses to a public address on the way out, and then map the public IP address to the private address on the return trip.

The objective of this architecture is to isolate AWS resources and data in one Amazon VPC from another Amazon VPC, and to help prevent data transferred from outside the Amazon network except where the

# D.5 Secure Data Handling

AWS provides many methods for customers to securely handle their data. There are additional methods detailed in the Complementary User Entity Controls at the end of this section. AWS enables customers to open a secure, encrypted channel to AWS servers using HTTPS (TLS/SSL).

Amazon S3 provides a mechanism that enables users to utilize MD5 checksums to validate that data sent to AWS is bitwise identical to what is received, and that data sent by Amazon S3 is identical to what is received by the user. When customers choose to provide their own keys for encryption and decryption of Amazon S3 objects (S3 SSE-C), Amazon S3 does not store the encryption key provided by the customer. Amazon S3 generates and stores a one-way salted HMAC of the customer encryption key and that salted HMAC value is not logged (Control AWSCA-4.4).

Upon initial communication with an AWS-provided Windows AMI, AWS enables secure communication by configuring Terminal Services on the instance and generating a unique self-signed X.509 server certificate and delivering the certificate’s thumbprint to the user over a trusted channel (Control AWSCA-4.2).

AWS further enables secure communication with Linux AMIs, by configuring SSH on the instance, generating a unique host-key and delivering the key’s fingerprint to the user over a trusted channel (Control AWSCA-4.1).

Connections between customer applications and Amazon RDS MySQL instances can be encrypted using TLS/SSL. Amazon RDS generates a TLS/SSL certificate for each database instance, which can be used to establish an encrypted connection using the default MySQL client. Once an encrypted connection is established, data transferred between the database instance and a customer’s application will be encrypted during transfer. If customers require data to be encrypted while “at rest” in the database, the customer application must manage the encryption and decryption of data. Additionally, customers can set up controls to have their database instances only accept encrypted connections for specific user accounts.

# D.6 Physical Security and Environmental Protection

Amazon has significant experience in designing, constructing, and operating large-scale data centers. This experience has been applied to the AWS system and infrastructure. Refer to the “Amazon Web Services System Overview” section above for list of in-scope data centers.

# Physical Security

AWS provides physical access to its data centers for approved employees and contractors who have a legitimate business need for such privileges. Access to data centers must be approved by an authorized individual (Control AWSCA-5.1). All visitors are required to present identification and are signed in and escorted by authorized staff.

When an employee or contractor no longer requires these privileges, his or her access is promptly revoked, even if he or she continues to be an employee of Amazon or AWS. In addition, access is automatically revoked when an employee’s record is terminated in Amazon’s HR system (Control AWSCA-5.2).

5.2). Cardholder access to data centers is reviewed quarterly. Cardholders marked for removal have their
access automatically revoked as part of the review (Control AWSCA-5.3).

Physical access is controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security
staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff
utilize multi-factor authentication mechanisms to access data center floors (Control AWSCA-5.4, AWSCA-
5.5, and AWSCA-5.6).

In addition to the physical security controls, physical access to data centers in the GovCloud (US) region is
restricted to employees or contractors who have been validated as a U.S. person (green card holder or
citizen as defined by the U.S. Department of State).

Amazon owns and operates many of its data centers, while others are housed in colocation spaces that
are offered by various reputable companies under contract with Amazon. The physical access and security
controls described above are also deployed by AWS at colocation spaces. In addition, AWS also has single
racks deployed in non-Amazon controlled facilities, Amazon CloudFront Extension (ACE). In these facilities,
the third-party vendor provides the first line of physical security that meets AWS’ established
requirements.

AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment managed and supported by AWS that
places AWS compute, storage, database and other select services closer to large population, industry, IT
centers or customers where no AWS Region currently exists today. With AWS Local Zones, customers can
easily run latency-sensitive portions of applications local to end-users and resources in a specific
geography, delivering single-digit millisecond latency for specific use cases. Dedicated Local Zones are
deployed on-premises, delivered in accordance with a customer specific contract, and dedicated to that
customer, that meets AWS established physical security requirements.

AWS offers Wavelength infrastructure in partnership with Telco providers, which is optimized for mobile
edge computing applications. Wavelength Zones are AWS infrastructure deployments that embed AWS
compute and storage services within communications service providers’ (CSP or telecom providers) data
centers at the edge of the 5G network, so application traffic from 5G devices can reach application servers
running in Wavelength Zones without leaving the telecommunications network. This avoids the latency
that would result from application traffic having to traverse multiple hops across the Internet to reach
their destination, enabling customers to take full advantage of the latency and bandwidth benefits offered
by modern 5G networks.

Contracts with third-party colocation providers include provisions to support the protection of AWS
assets, communication of incidents or events that impact Amazon assets and/or customers to AWS
(Control AWSCA-5.11). In addition, AWS provides monitoring of adherence with security and operational
standards by performing periodic reviews of colocation service providers (Control AWSCA-5.12). The
frequency of colocation reviews is based on a tiering that is dependent on the contracts and level of
engagement with the colocation service provider.

AWS spaces within colocation facilities are installed with AWS-operated CCTV, intrusion detection
systems, and access control devices that alert AWS personnel of access and incidents. Physical access to
AWS spaces within colocation facilities is controlled by AWS and follows standard AWS access
management processes.

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

# Redundancy

Data centers are designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels. Each AWS Region is comprised of multiple data centers. All data centers are online and serving traffic; no data center is “cold.” In case of failure, automated processes move traffic away from the affected area. Core applications are deployed to an N+1 standard, so that in the event of a data center failure, there is sufficient capacity to enable traffic to be load-balanced to the remaining sites.

# Fire Detection and Suppression

Automatic fire detection and suppression equipment has been installed to reduce risk. The fire detection system utilizes smoke detection sensors in Amazon-owned data center environments (e.g., VESDA, point source detection), mechanical and electrical infrastructure spaces, chiller rooms, and generator equipment rooms. These areas are protected by either wet-pipe, double-interlocked pre-action, or gaseous sprinkler systems (Control AWSCA-5.7).

# Power

The data center electrical power systems supporting AWS are designed to be fully redundant and maintainable without impact to operations, 24 hours a day, and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units provide back-up power in the event of an electrical failure for critical and essential loads in Amazon-owned data centers and third-party colocation sites where Amazon maintains the UPS units. Amazon-owned data centers use generators to provide back-up power for the facility (Control AWSCA-5.9 and AWSCA-5.10).

# Climate and Temperature

Climate control is required to maintain a constant operating temperature for servers and other hardware, which prevents overheating and reduces the possibility of service outages. Amazon-owned data centers are conditioned to maintain atmospheric conditions at specified levels. Personnel and systems monitor and control temperature and humidity at appropriate levels. This is provided at N+1 and also utilizes free cooling as primary source of cooling when and where it is available based on local environmental conditions (Control AWSCA-5.8).

# Environment Management

In Amazon-owned data centers, AWS monitors electrical, mechanical, and life support systems and equipment so that any issues are immediately identified. This is carried out by utilizing the Continuous Audit Tool (CAT) for daily rounds and readings, in tandem with an overview of our data centers provided via AWS’ Building Management System (BMS) and Electrical Monitoring System (EMS). Preventative maintenance is performed to maintain the continued operability of equipment utilizing the Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) tool and trouble ticketing and change management system. The primary objective of this program is to provide a holistic insight into Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing (MEP) Assets owned by AWS infrastructure teams. This includes providing a centralized repository for equipment, optimizing planned and unplanned maintenance and managing data center critical spare parts.

# Management of Media

When a storage device has reached the end of its useful life, AWS procedures include a decommissioning process that is designed to prevent unauthorized access to assets. AWS uses techniques detailed in NIST 800-88 (“Guidelines for Media Sanitization”) as part of the decommissioning process. All production media is securely decommissioned in accordance with industry-standard practices (Control AWSCA-5.13). Production media is not removed from AWS control until it has been securely decommissioned.

# AWS Change Management Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

# D.7 Change Management

AWS applies a systematic approach to managing changes so that changes to customer impacting services are reviewed, tested, approved, and well communicated. Change management processes are based on Amazon change management guidelines and tailored to the specifics of each AWS service (Control AWSCA-6.1). These processes are documented and communicated to the necessary personnel by service team management.

The goal of AWS’ change management process is to prevent unintended service disruptions and maintain the integrity of service to the customer. Change details are documented in one of Amazon’s change management or deployment tools (Control AWSCA-6.2).

Prior to deployment to production environments, changes are:

- Developed: in a development environment that is segregated from the production environment (Control AWSCA-6.4). Customer content is not used in test and development environments.
- Reviewed: by peers for technical aspects and appropriateness (Control AWSCA-6.5).
- Tested: to confirm the changes will behave as expected when applied and not adversely impact performance (Control AWSCA-6.3).
- Approved: by authorized team members to provide appropriate oversight and understanding of business impact (Control AWSCA-6.5).

Changes are typically pushed into production in a phased deployment starting with lowest impact sites. Deployments are closely monitored so impact can be evaluated. Service owners have a number of configurable metrics that measure the health of the service’s upstream dependencies. These metrics are closely monitored with thresholds and alarming in place (e.g., latency, availability, fatal errors, CPU utilization, etc.). Customer information, including personal information, and customer content are not used in test and development environments (Control AWSCA-6.7). Rollback procedures are documented so that team members can revert back to the previous state if needed.

When possible, changes are scheduled during regular change windows. Emergency changes to production systems that require deviations from standard change management procedures are associated with an incident and are logged and approved as appropriate.

AWS performs deployment validations and change reviews to detect unauthorized changes to its environment and tracks identified issues to resolution. On a monthly basis, as part of the AWS Security Assurance business review, AWS management reviews and tracks deployment violations for services enrolled in the Deployment Monitoring program. For those services not enrolled in the Deployment Monitoring program, a secondary monthly review of deployments is conducted within 60 days of the month in which they were made. If any unauthorized changes are detected or deviates from the standard review and approval process, they are tracked to resolution (Control AWSCA-6.6).

# Infrastructure

AWS internally developed configuration management software is installed when new hardware is.

#

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Provisioned tools are run on all UNIX hosts to validate configuration and software installation based on host classes and updated regularly.

Only approved users with verified business needs are authorized to log in to central configuration management servers. Host configuration settings are monitored for compliance with AWS security standards and automatically pushed to the host fleet.

Emergency, non-routine, and other configuration changes to existing AWS infrastructure are authorized, logged, tested, approved, and documented following industry norms. Updates are performed to minimize impact on customers, with communication through email or the AWS Health Dashboard.

# Data Integrity, Availability, Redundancy, and Data Retention

AWS maintains data integrity through all phases including transmission, storage, and processing. Amazon S3 uses checksums internally to ensure data integrity in transit and at rest. Data retention is in place until customer removal or agreement termination.

AWS Resiliency Program addresses major availability events with proactive risk mitigation strategies, including separate Availability Zones and continuous infrastructure capacity planning.

Contingency plans and incident response playbooks are regularly updated to reflect emerging risks and past incidents.

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

Through the due course of business, the AWS Resiliency Plan is tested, reviewed, and approved by senior leadership annually (Control AWSCA-10.3).

AWS has identified critical system components required to maintain availability and recover service in case of an outage. Critical system components are backed up across multiple isolated locations known as Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone operates on its own physically distinct infrastructure, engineered for high reliability. Common points of failure are not shared across Availability Zones, ensuring resilience even in the face of uncommon disasters like fires, tornados, or flooding. AWS replicates critical system components across multiple Availability Zones and maintains authoritative backups to ensure successful replication (Control AWSCA-10.1 and AWSCA-10.2).

# Data Backup

AWS core storage services can be redundantly stored in multiple physical locations as part of normal operations. Customers can enable backups of their data across AWS services.

Amazon S3 is designed to provide 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a year. Objects are redundantly stored on multiple devices across facilities in an Amazon S3 region. Amazon S3 ensures durability by synchronously storing customer content across multiple facilities, maintaining object integrity through checksums and repairing lost redundancy (Control AWSCA-7.3, AWSCA-7.4, and AWSCA-7.5).

Amazon EBS replication is stored within the same availability zone, but customers can take regular snapshots to Amazon S3 for long-term data durability. Backups to Amazon S3 can be performed through the database management system for complex transactional databases using Amazon EBS (Control AWSCA-7.6).

Amazon RDS offers automated backups and database snapshots for customer DB Instances, enabling point-in-time recovery and user-initiated backups. The automatic backup feature stores databases and transaction logs for a user-specified retention period, allowing restoration to any second within the defined period. DB Snapshots are full database backups that customers can create new DB Instances from (Control AWSCA-7.6).

Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS continuously monitors service usage to project infrastructure needs to support availability commitments and requirements. AWS maintains a capacity planning model to assess infrastructure usage and demands at least monthly, and usually more frequently (e.g., weekly). In addition, the AWS capacity planning model supports the planning of future demands to acquire and implement additional resources based upon current resources and forecasted requirements (Control AWSCA-10.4).

Confidentiality

AWS is committed to protecting the security and confidentiality of its customers’ content, defined as “Your Content” at https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/ (Control AWSCA-11.3). AWS’ systems and services are designed to enable authenticated AWS customers to access and manage their content. AWS notifies customers of third-party access to a customer’s content on the third-party access page located at https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/third-party-access. AWS may remove a customer’s content when compelled to do so by a legal order, or where there is evidence of fraud or abuse as described in the Customer Agreement (https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) and Acceptable Use Policy (https://aws.amazon.com/aup/). In executing the removal of a customer’s content due to the reasons stated above, employees may render it inaccessible as the situation requires. For clarity, this capability to render customer content inaccessible extends to encrypted content as well.

In the course of AWS system and software design, build, and test of product features, a customer’s content is not used and remains in the production environment. A customer’s content is not required for the AWS software development life cycle. When content is required for the development or test of a service’s software, AWS service teams have tools to generate mock, random data.

AWS knows customers care about privacy and data security. That is why AWS gives customers ownership and control over their content by design through tools that allow customers to determine where their content is stored, secure their content in transit or at rest, and manage access to AWS services and resources. AWS also implements technical and physical controls designed to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of a customer’s content. As described in the Physical Security and Change Management areas in Section III of this report, AWS employs a number of controls to safeguard data from within and outside of the boundaries of environments which store a customer’s content. As a result of these measures, access to a customer’s content is restricted to authorized parties.

AWS contingency plans and incident response playbooks have defined and tested tools and processes to detect, mitigate, investigate, and assess security incidents. These plans and playbooks include guidelines for responding to potential data breaches in accordance with contractual and regulatory requirements. AWS security engineers follow a protocol when responding to potential data security incidents. The protocol involves steps, which include validating the presence of customer content within the AWS service (without actually viewing the data), determining the encryption status of a customer’s content, and determining improper access to a customer’s content to the extent possible.

During the course of their response, the security engineers document relevant findings in internal tools used to track the security issue. AWS Security Leadership is regularly apprised of all data security issue investigations. In the event there are positive indicators that customer content was potentially accessed by an unintended party, a security engineer engages AWS Security Leadership and the AWS Legal team to review the findings. AWS Security Leadership and the Legal team review the findings and determine if a

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

In connection with that customer's account, and any computational results that a customer or any end user derives from the foregoing through their use of AWS services. For example, customer content includes content that a customer or any end user stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). The terms of the AWS Customer Agreement (https://aws.amazon.com/agreement/) and AWS Service Terms (https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) apply to customer content.

Account information is information about a customer that a customer provides to AWS in connection with the creation or administration of a customer account. For example, account information includes names, user names, phone numbers, email addresses, and billing information associated with a customer account. Any information submitted by the customer that AWS needs in order to provide services to the customer or in connection with the administration of customer accounts, is not in-scope for this report.

The AWS Privacy Notice is available from the AWS website at https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/. The AWS Privacy Notice is reviewed by the AWS Legal team, and is updated as required to reflect Amazon’s current business practices and global regulatory requirements. The Privacy Notice describes how AWS collects and uses a customer’s personal information in relation to AWS websites, applications, products, services, events, and experiences. The Privacy Notice does not apply to customer content.

As part of the AWS account creation and activation process, AWS customers are informed of the AWS Privacy Notice and are required to accept the Customer Agreement, including the terms and conditions related to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of their data. Customers are responsible for determining what content to store within AWS, which may include personal information. Without the acceptance of the Customer Agreement, customers cannot sign up to use the AWS services.

The AWS Customer Agreement informs customers of the AWS data security and privacy commitments prior to activating an AWS account and is made available to customers to review at any time on the AWS website (Control AWSCA-12.1).

The customer determines what data is entered into AWS services and has the ability to configure the appropriate security and privacy settings for the data, including who can access and use the data. Further, the customer is able to choose not to provide certain data. Additionally, the customer manages notification or consent requirements, and maintains the accuracy of the data.

Additionally, the AWS Customer Agreement notes how AWS shares, secures, and retains customer content. AWS also informs customers of updates to the Customer Agreement by making it available on its website and providing the last updated date. Customers should check the Customer Agreement website frequently for any changes to the Customer Agreement (Control AWSCA-12.2).

AWS does not store any customer cardholder data obtained from customers. Rather, AWS passes the customer cardholder data and sends it immediately to the Amazon Payments Platform, the PCI-certified platform that Amazon uses for all payment processing. This platform returns a unique identifier that AWS stores and uses for all future processing. The Amazon Payments Platform sits completely outside of the AWS boundary and is run by the larger Amazon entity. It is not an AWS service, but it is utilized by the larger Amazon entity for payment processing. As such, the Amazon payment platform is not in-scope for this report.

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS offers customers the ability to update their communication preferences through the AWS console
or via the AWS Email Preference Center (Control AWSCA-12.3). When customers update their
communication preferences using their email, their updated preferences are saved. Customers can
unsubscribe from AWS marketing emails within the AWS console. AWS Customers will still receive
important account-related notifications from AWS, such as monthly billing statements, or if there are
significant changes to a service that customers use.

AWS provides authenticated customers the ability to access, update, and confirm their data. Denial of
access will be communicated using the AWS console (Control AWSCA-12.6). Customers can sign into to
their AWS accounts through the AWS console to view and update their data.

AWS (or Amazon) does not disclose customer information in response to government demands unless
we're required to do so to comply with a legally valid and binding order. AWS Legal reviews and maintains
records of all the information requests, which lists information on the types and volume of information
requested. Unless AWS is prohibited from doing so or there is clear indication of illegal conduct in
connection with the use of Amazon products or services, AWS notifies customers before disclosing
customer content so they can seek protection from disclosure. AWS shares customer content only as
described in the AWS Customer Agreement.

AWS may produce non-content and/or content information in response to valid and binding law
enforcement and governmental requests, such as subpoenas, court orders, and search warrants. “Non-
content information” means customer information such as name, address, email address, billing
information, date of account creation, and service usage information. “Content information” includes the
content that a customer transfers for processing, storage, or hosting in connection with AWS services and
any computational results. AWS records customer information requests to maintain a complete, accurate,
and timely record of such requests (Control AWSCA-12.7).

If required, customers are responsible for providing notice to the individuals whose data the customer
collects and uses within AWS. AWS is not responsible for providing such notice to or obtaining consent
from these individuals and is only responsible for communicating its privacy commitments to AWS
customers, which is provided during the account creation and activation process.

AWS has documented an incident response policy and plan which outlines an organized approach for
responding to security breaches and incidents. The AWS Security team is responsible for monitoring
systems, tracking issues, and documenting findings of security-related events. Records are maintained for
security breaches and incidents, which includes status information required for supporting forensic
activities, trend analysis, and evaluation of incident details.

As part of the process, potential breaches of customer content are investigated and escalated to AWS
Security and AWS Legal. Affected customers and regulators are notified of breaches and incidents where
legally required. Customers can subscribe to the AWS Security Bulletins page, which provides information
regarding identified security issues. AWS notifies affected customers and regulators of breaches and
incidents as legally required in accordance with team processes (Control AWSCA-12.5).

AWS retains and disposes of customer content in accordance with the Customer Agreement and the AWS
Data Classification and Handling Policy. When a customer terminates their account or contract with AWS,
the account is put under isolation; after which within 90 days, customers can restore their accounts and

# AWS System Description

# Section III – Description of the Amazon Web Services System

AWS services hosting customer content are designed to retain customer content until the contractual obligation to retain a customer’s content ends or a customer-initiated action to remove or delete the content is taken (Control AWSCA-7.8). When a customer requests data to be deleted, AWS utilizes automated processes to detect that request and make the content inaccessible. After the deletion is complete, automated actions are taken on deleted content to render the content unreadable (Control AWSCA-7.7).

AWS performs application security reviews for Third-Party systems that integrate with AWS, to ascertain security risks are identified and mitigated (Control AWSCA-12.4). A typical security review considers privacy components, such as retention period, use, and collection of data as applicable. The review starts with a system owner initiating a review request to the dedicated AWS Vendor Security (AVS) team, and submitting detailed information about the artifacts being reviewed. A Security review is required if an AWS Team engages with a new external party for collecting data or modifications to existing systems.

During this process, the AVS team determines the granularity of review required based on the artifact’s design, threat model, and impact to AWS’ risk profile. They provide security guidance, validate security assurance material, and meet with external parties to discuss their penetration tests, Software Development Life Cycle, change management processes, and other operating security controls. They work with the system owner to identify, prioritize, and remediate security findings. The AVS team collaborates with AWS Legal as needed to validate that changes are in-line with AWS privacy policies. The AVS team provides their final approval for the third-party system after they have adequately assessed the risks and worked with the requester to implement security controls to mitigate identified risks.

# Monitoring

# Monitoring Activities

AWS utilizes a wide variety of automated monitoring systems to provide a high level of service performance and availability. AWS defines a Security Incident as a security-related adverse event in which there was a loss of data confidentiality, disruption of data or systems integrity, or disruption or denial of availability. AWS monitoring tools are implemented to detect unusual or unauthorized activities and conditions at ingress and egress communication points. These tools monitor server and network usage, port scanning activities, application usage, and unauthorized intrusion attempts.

Systems within AWS are further designed to monitor key operational metrics and alarms are configured to automatically notify operations and management personnel when early warning thresholds are crossed. An on-call schedule is used such that personnel are always available to respond to operational issues. This includes a pager system, so that notifications are quickly and reliably communicated to operations personnel (Control AWSCA-8.1).

Documentation is maintained to aid and inform operations personnel in handling incidents or issues. A ticketing system is used which supports communication, progress updates, necessary collaboration between teams, and logging capabilities. Trained call leaders facilitate communication and progress during the handling of operational issues that require collaboration. After action reviews are convened following any significant operational issue, regardless of external impact, and Correction of Errors (COE) documents are composed such that the root cause is captured and preventative actions may be taken for

# SOC Control Adjustment Overview

The section below provides an overview of the key changes to SOC controls that occurred during the Fall 2023 (10/01/2022 - 9/30/2023) reporting period from previous reports.

# Section I: Modifications to existing controls

|OLD – Fall 2022|NEW – Spring 2023|
|---|---|
|AWSCA-4.5: KMS-Specific – KMS keys used for cryptographic operations in KMS are logically secured so that no single AWS employee can gain access to the key material.|AWSCA-4.5: KMS-Specific – KMS keys used for cryptographic operations in KMS are logically secured so that no AWS employee can gain access to the key material.|

Rationale: In an effort of continuous improvement, AWS updates the report to reflect its most current process documentation. The previous control language implied that multiple AWS employees in quorum can access the key material which is not the case. No significant change to the control design and operation.

# Appendix – Glossary of Terms

AMI: An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is an encrypted machine image stored in Amazon S3. It contains all the information necessary to boot instances of a customer’s software.

API: Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface in computer science that defines the ways by which an application program may request services from libraries and/or operating systems.

Authentication: Authentication is the process of determining whether someone or something is, in fact, who or what it is declared to be.

Availability Zone: Amazon EC2 locations are composed of regions and Availability Zones. Availability Zones are distinct locations that are engineered to be insulated from failures in other Availability Zones and provide inexpensive, low latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same region.

Bucket: A container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is contained within a bucket. More information can be found in Amazon S3 Basics.

AWS Content: “AWS Content” means Content we or any of our affiliates make available in connection with the Services or on the AWS Site to allow access to and use of the Services, including APIs; WSDLs; Documentation; sample code; software libraries; command line tools; roofs of concept; templates; and other related technology (including any of the foregoing that are provided by our personnel). AWS Content does not include the Services or Third-Party Content.

Customer Content: Defined as “Your Content” in AWS Customer Agreement.

HMAC: In cryptography, a keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC or KHMAC), is a type of message authentication code (MAC) calculated using a specific algorithm involving a cryptographic hash function in combination with a secret key. As with any MAC, it may be used to simultaneously verify both the data integrity and the authenticity of a message. Any iterative cryptographic hash function, such as MD5 or SHA-1, may be used in the calculation of an HMAC; the resulting MAC algorithm is termed HMAC-MD5 or HMAC-SHA1, accordingly. The cryptographic strength of the HMAC depends upon the cryptographic strength of the underlying hash function, on the size and quality of the key and the size of the hash output length in bits.

Personal Information: Personal information that AWS collects in the course of providing AWS’ offerings include:
- Information You Give Us: We collect any information you provide in relation to AWS Offerings. Click here to see examples of information you give us.
- Automatic Information: We automatically collect certain types of information when you interact with AWS Offerings. Click here to see examples of information we collect automatically.
- Information from Other Sources: We might collect information about you from other sources, including service providers, partners, and publicly available sources. Click here to see examples of information we collect from other sources.

Hypervisor:
A hypervisor, also called Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), is computer software/hardware virtualization software that allows multiple operating systems to run on a host computer concurrently.

IP Address:
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical label that is assigned to devices participating in a computer network utilizing the Internet Protocol for communication between its nodes.

IP Spoofing:
Creation of Internet Protocol (IP) packets with a forged source IP address, called spoofing, with the purpose of concealing the identity of the sender or impersonating another computing system.

MD5 checksums:
In cryptography, MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value. As an Internet standard (RFC 1321), MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files.

Object:
The fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object data and metadata. The data portion is opaque to Amazon S3. The metadata is a set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These include some default metadata such as the date last modified and standard HTTP metadata such as Content-Type. The developer can also specify custom metadata at the time the Object is stored.

Port Scanning:
A port scan is a series of messages sent by someone attempting to break into a computer to learn which computer network services, each associated with a “well-known” port number, the computer provides.

Privacy Policy:
“Privacy Policy” means the privacy policy located at https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/ (and any successor or related locations designated by us), as it may be updated by AWS from time to time.

User entity:
The entities that use the services of a service organization during some or all of the review period.

Service:
Software or computing ability provided across a network (e.g., Amazon EC2, Amazon S3).

Service Organization:
An organization or segment of an organization that provides services to user entities that are likely to be relevant to those user entities’ internal control over financial reporting.

Signature Version 4:
Signature Version 4 is the process to add authentication information to AWS requests. For security, most requests to AWS must be signed with an access key, which consists of an access key ID and secret access key.

Subservice Organization:
A service organization used by another service organization to perform some of the services provided to user entities that are likely to be relevant to those user entities’ internal control over financial reporting.

Virtual Instance:
Once an AMI has been launched, the resulting running system is referred to as a virtual instance. All instances based on the same AMI start out identical and any information on them is lost when the instances are terminated or fail.

X.509:
In cryptography, X.509 is an ITU-T standard for a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for Single Sign-On (SSO) and Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI). X.509 specifies, among other things, standard formats for public key certificates, certificate revocation lists, attribute certificates and a certification path validation algorithm.
